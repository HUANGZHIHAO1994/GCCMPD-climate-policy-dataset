(https://carbon-pulse.com/44724/) Mexico will launch a pilot national emissions trading scheme in Aug. 2018 with a three-year pilot phase. The pilot is scheduled to last 36 months, between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2022. ""The pilot will cover the energy and industry sectors. Energy encompasses both electricity generation and fossil-fuel extraction and production. Industry includes, among others, the automotive, cement, chemicals, glass, steel, metallurgical, mining, and petrochemicals subsectors, as well as the pulp and paper subsector. Only direct CO2 emissions will be regulated through the pilot, and participation is limited to entities with annual emissions greater than 100,000tCO2. The system is expected to cover around 300 entities in this phase, corresponding to approximately 45% of national emissions."" (ICAP 2019)
New Developments: In 2017, Mexico began a simulation of a voluntary Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and the General Climate Change Law makes the scheme mandatory as soon as its three-year pilot phase concludes. The pilot phase—originally planned to start in August 2018—started operation in January 2020. The ETS will not replace the existing carbon tax.","Energy efficiency, Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Non-energy use, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch, Renewables",,"In force",2018,2020,,High,Mitigation,"https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/news-archive/645-mexico-releases-new-draft-regulations-for-pilot-ets#:~:text=%20Mexico%20releases%20new%20draft%20regulations%20for%20pilot;of%20the%20cap%20will%20be%20set...%20More%20

By the end of the Strategy third implementation phase, the proportion of Eastern energy markets in the Russian energy export of liquid hydrocarbons (oil and oil products) should grow from the current 6 to 22–25%, while natural gas export should grow from 0 to 19–20%. The Strategy sets a 56 percent energy intensity reduction target for 2030 (compared with 2005). It will be accomplished in three stages: the first is a major overhaul of the energy sector; the second emphasizes efficiency gains through new technology within the fuel and energy sectors; and the third stresses economy-wide energy efficiency.

The targets set for 2030 are as follows:
- Double the energy self-sufficiency ratio (18% at present, including nuclear power generation) and the domestically-developed fossil fuel supply ratio* (26% at present), and raise the energy independence ratio to about 70 percent from the present 38 percent.
*The ratio of fossil fuel supply from domestic and overseas interests that a Japanese company has a share in the total supply
- Raise the ratio of energy from zero-emission power sources such as nuclear and renewable energy to 70 percent (by more than 50% in 2020) from the present 34%. For this purpose:
Build more than 14 additional nuclear plants (nine by 2020).
Raise the overall plant capacity utilization rate to 90 percent (85% by 2020) from the 60% in 2008.
Maximize the use of renewable energy.
Cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the residential sector by half.
Maintain and raise energy efficiency in the industrial sector to the highest level in the world.
Maintain or achieve top-level shares of global markets for energy-related products and systems.
According to the plan, the goal is to reduce domestic energy-related CO2 emissions by 30 percent in 2030 compared to the 1990 level. Its intention was to increase nuclear energy in the mix to raise Japan's level of energy self-sufficiency, on the assumption this would also enhance energy security. (Although Japan imports all the uranium it needs for nuclear power generation, nuclear power was deemed a ""quasi-domestic energy"" because the government considers it possible to recycle nuclear fuel at home, if the nuclear fuel cycle is based on reprocessing used fuel and using it in fast-breeder reactors.)

The NDC sets for the electricity sector a goal of 50% share of clean energy (renewables and nuclear) in the installed power capacity mix by 2050, since UAE is investing in solar energy and nuclear energy. UAE is on track to reach 14 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. A grid-based clean power, distributed electricity generation, rooftop solar photovoltaic in particular, is being promoted in the Emirate of Dubai. As a last strategy, regulatory measures and technology deployment are envisioned to increase efficiency of energy consumption with an end goal to reduce it by 40% by 2050 with periodic tariff reforms.
In the building sector, codes and standards are the main instrument, with green building regulations and rating schemes for new buildings. Standards and labels may enable informed consumer choices, thus UAE has established an Energy Efficiency Standardization and Labelling Program which covers a range of household goods and appliances. The approach for the industry sector is based on voluntary targets of carbon usage reduction and looking at the transport one a fuel pricing reform (international prices for gasoline, quality standards for fuel and motor and stimulation of a sustainable transport (shifting transport modals for a public one or electric cars) are the strategy disclosed.
CAT calculates the new target to be 246MtCO2 and highly insufficient  and emphasises that there is no mention of net-zero target (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

It is an absolute target using 2005 as reference year.  Brazil proposes a target to reduce by 37% by 2025 and by 43% by 2030 relative to 2005 levels. Nevertheless, it does not translate in absolute numbers, referring to Brazil’s Third National Communication of the country to see the emissions level in the base year.
Regarding long-term strategy, from 2021 onwards Brazil states it requires US$ 10 billion per year to realize environmental pledges, including conservation of native vegetation and states that the function of market mechanisms is paramount to achieve carbon neutrality earlier than 2060.
According to CAT, the Brazilian updated NDC is weaker than the previous one, being rated 'Highly insufficient"". The CAT shows that an increase in the emissions used as reference data allows Brazil to increase its emissions over than 400 MtCO2e still meeting the relative proposed target (1,453 MtCO2e in 2025 and 1,307 in 2030).
Another rollback is the removal of explicit sectoral mitigation targets, especially those related to halt illegal deforestation in the Amazon.","Energy efficiency, Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Non-energy use, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch, Renewables",,"In force",2020,2021,2030,Unknown,"Adaptation, Mitigation","https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Brazil%20First/Brazil%20First%20NDC%20(Updated%20submission).pdf

For CO2, CH4 and N2O the reference year is 1990 and for F-gases the reference year is 1995. The UK’s overall absolute target is to reduce GHG emissions at least by 68% (including LULUCF) by 2030 compared with reference levels. Emissions from International Aviation and Shipping are not included.
The UK has a policy framework in force establishing the binding commitment of net zero emissions by 2050, and Scotland sets bolder goals to reach net-zero in 2045 and 75% below 1990 by 2030. Wales pledges at least 80% reduction by 2050. 
The Climate Change Act introduced carbon budgets for the UK Government, which cap emissions over successive five-year periods and must be set 12 years in advance.
The UK government is putting into force the Clean Growth Strategy, which is a Ten Point Plan for a green industrial revolution, encompassing clean energy, buildings, transport and technologies. Moreover, the government pushes for individual plans across key sectors such as Energy White Paper, Transport Decarbonisation Plan and Heat and Buildings Strategy (UK NDC, 2020).
UK’s NDC establishes a reduction of 68% of 1990 levels including LULUCF emissions. If LULUCF is excluded, this is equivalent to 69% or 251 MtCO2e. CAT classifies this as strong target and once the UK adopts national policies (2030 ban on the sale of fossil fuel cars and a ramping up of renewable energy investment, particularly into offshore wind) it will bring their emissions in line with the 1.5°C goal. Also, the UK has a net-zero goal by 2050. CAT cannot rate, at this moment, the UK target due to complexities derived from Brexit (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

The Law introduces several development schemes for the private development of renewable energy projects, including competitive bids, feed-in tariff, and independent power production through third party access.
Competitive bidding to be run by the New and Renewable Energy Authority (“NREA”) open to private sector companies for construction of the renewable power projects. Constructed stations will be operated by NREA. Produced electricity will be sold to Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC) at a regulated price determined by Egyptian Electric Utility and Consumer Protection Regulatory Agency (ERA).
Competitive bidding mechanism for build-own-operate (BOO) contracts to be run by EETC and open to private companies for construction, ownership and operation of the renewable power projects. Generated electricity will be sold to EETC on the price agreed between EETC and plant owner.
Feed-in tariff (FIT) support system under which private sector investors are allowed to build, own and operate renewable energy power stations and sell generated electricity to EETC or to licensed distribution companies via power purchase agreements (PPA). PPA determines duration of the contract and a fix electricity price (feed-in tariff). PPA for feed-in tariffs for solar installations will last 20 years, for wind projects 25 years. Egypt aims to deploy 4300 MW of new renewable capacity under FIT scheme between 2015 and 2017. FIT system is open only for solar PV and wind technologies.
Independent power production through third party access scheme allows independent power producers (IPP) to enter bilateral electricity purchase contracts with eligible consumers and sell them produced electricity directly.

• Alberta will phase out all coal-fired electricity generation in the province by 2030.
• Approximately 1/3 of this capacity will be replaced with natural gas, and 2/3 with renewables (up to 30% of Alberta’s total production).
• In the interim, Alberta will impose a carbon tax of $20 a tonne in 2017, $30 a tonne in 2018, and increasing in real terms after that. For the electricity sector, this will apply to coal-fired emissions above what Alberta’s cleanest natural gas-fired plan would emit for the same amount of electricity production.
In November, 2016, the Government of Alberta announced the first competition for new renewable energy development will begin in early 2017 with the successful bidders awarded at the end of 2017. It will be for up to 400 MW of renewable energy. The Government of Alberta also announced major changes to the electricity system. This includes:
• An electricity price ceiling of 6.8 cents/KWh from June 2017 until June 2021
• Partial re-regulation of the Alberta energy market (details TBA)
• Introduction of a capacity market (paired with the existing generation market), to encourage development of renewable generation. The market will be in place by 2021.
• Plan to introduce Bill 34, the Electric Utilities Amendment Act, would allow the Balancing Pool to borrow money from the province to manage its funding obligations.

An interest-free loan up to EUR 10 000 is provided, and an interest rate of 2.5% for the remaining amount, for the purchase of a new vehicle when a vehicle over 10 years old or with over 250 000km is traded in. The new passenger car purchased cannot emit more than 120g CO2/km, or 140kg CO2/km if incorporating electronic control systems or a three-way catalyst for gasoline vehicles and EGR exhaust gas recirculation devices for diesel vehicles. The limit is 160g CO2/km for light commercial vehicles. In November, the Plan was modified to include the purchase of used cars, on the condition that they are not more than five years old, and the vehicle scrapped is at least 15 years old.

The objective of this Regulation is to protect the environment by reducing emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases. Accordingly, this Regulation:
(a) establishes rules on containment, use, recovery and destruction of fluorinated greenhouse gases, and on related ancillary measures;
(b) imposes conditions on the placing on the market of specific products and equipment that contain, or whose functioning relies upon, fluorinated greenhouse gases;
(c) imposes conditions on specific uses of fluorinated greenhouse gases; and
(d) establishes quantitative limits for the placing on the market of hydrofluorocarbons.
Non-CO2 emissions, including fluorinated greenhouse gases but excluding non-CO2 emissions from agriculture, should be reduced by 72 % to 73 % by 2030 and by 70 % to 78 % by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. If based on the reference year 2005, a reduction in non-CO2 emissions, except those from agriculture, of 60 % to 61 % by 2030 is required. Fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions were estimated at 90 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2 equivalent in 2005.
The Commission report of 26 September 2011 on the application, effects and adequacy of Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) concluded that the current containment measures, if fully applied, have the potential to reduce emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases. Those measures should therefore be maintained and clarified on the basis of the experience gained in implementing them

The use of sulphur hexafluoride to fill vehicle tyres shall be prohibited. From 1 January 2020, the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases, with a global warming potential of 2 500 or more, to service or maintain refrigeration equipment with a charge size of 40 tonnes of CO2 equivalent or more, shall be prohibited.

The sectors covered are electricity, transport, building (cooking, lightning). The emissions of the industry sector are negligible. The gases covered are carbon dioxide (CO2) methane (CH4) nitrous oxide (N2O).
In the electricity sector, the NDC focuses on investing in electricity grid upgrades to improve grid stability, minimize system losses (currently around 30%) and accommodate more variable generation from renewable energy. The country intends to shift from diesel towards renewables in the next decade. In the building sector, the focus will be on energy efficiency (future building codes, retrofits and best performance of appliances) and replacement of diesel generators as well as tariffs to disincentive consumption. In the transportation sector, policies to encourage public transportation, cycling and walking is the kernel for future actions, nevertheless, identifying policy options for the uptake of electric vehicles is also envisaged.

Article 3 of the Energy Act contains targets to achieve a reduction in per capita energy consumption by 43% by 2035 below 2000 levels and a reduction in per capita electricity consumption of 13% below 2000 levels by 2035.
To replace nuclear energy in the long-term and decrease electricity imports, the Energy Law also includes an indicative target for 11.4 TWh of domestically produced renewable energy (excluding hydro) by 2035 and 37.4 GWh in 2035 of hydropower.
To accompany the increasing share of intermittent renewable energy (wind, solar) Switzerland plans to expand and restructure the transmission grids and pool power plants to ensure temporary power balancing, as well as storage and reserve capacities.
Regarding the transport sector, and in line with the EU standards, the Energy Strategy 2050 includes CO2 emissions regulations for newly-registered vehicles that will decrease to 95 gCO2/km in passenger cars by 2020, and to 147 gCO2/km for utility vehicles and light semi-trailers

Furthermore, its end goal is to be a net-zero country in 2050.
For that some overarching actions are proposed between 2021 and 2030, for instance set a carbon cap by 2023 and reduce deforestation with international aid to a net zero by 2030 or to 50.000ha unconditionally.
The policy focuses on the 6 mitigation areas, overarching sectors. The NDC presents the use of codes and standards to reduce energy consumption, support sustainable constructions and replace old and out-dated devices and vehicles. The carbon pricing and tax aim to reduce the use of fossil fuels and also create revenue to invest in renewables. In the electricity area, the NDC mentions an improvement in energy efficiency to optimise the dispatch of electrical energy and the promotion and diversification of the energy matrix and exploitation of natural gas from landfills. In the building sector, improving performance appliances are pointed as a way forward. In the transport sector the NDC outlines the creation of a regulatory and financial environment that allows accelerating the transition towards electric mobility and Modernisation of HDV and, lastly, in the industry sector the fuel switch to a less intensive one will reduce the emissions of CO2e and in the LULUCF ecological restoration and reduction of deforestation are the core (Colombia NDC, 2020).

In this submission, Norway committed to a reduction of at least 50% and towards 55% compared to 1990 levels by 2030 (52 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF). Norway will implement its NDC jointly with the EU and Iceland, nevertheless it intends to go beyond the EU in the target of 40%, using voluntary collaboration under Article 6 of Paris Agreement.
Economic measures like CO2- taxes and emission trading are central to Norwegian climate policy, but also CCS technologies, electric vehicles and renewable energy will be supported. The following policy instruments are outlined: the EU-ETS; Effort Sharing Regulation (ERS), regulating carbon emissions that fall outside EU-ETS, whereby the Norwegian binding target is to reduce emissions by 40% in 2030 compared with 2005; and LULUCF, which is ought to reach net zero by 2030 (Norway NDC, 2020).
CAT evaluates Norway’s updated NDC as a progress but still insufficient to reach Paris Agreement goals. The present target establishes a reduction of at least 50% relative to 1990 levels by 2030, aiming for 55% (47 – 52% excluding LULUCF according to CAT). In CAT analysis, this new NDC will result in emissions between 24.6 and 27.2 MtCO2e in 2030, falling in a range warming that may reach between 2 and 3 degrees (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).","Energy efficiency, Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Non-energy use, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch, Renewables",,"In force",2020,2021,2030,Unknown,Mitigation,"https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Norway%20First/Norway_updatedNDC_2020%20(Updated%20submission).pdf

In order to do that, it will be necessary to establish management systems for the greenhouse gas emission of the industrial sector as tools to improve competitiveness, in a process similar to the implementation of environmental management systems in the past.
“The design and implementation of the sector plan is based on the rules established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and do not affect the ongoing validity of such rules, including the commitment with international financial and technological support for the actions of countries not included in Annex and flexibilities for them with regard to measurement, communication and verification of emissions and emission reductions.
“The Industry Plan is based on three pillars:
(i) Gradual implementation of a measurement, reporting and verification system (MRV) for the emission of greenhouse gases produced by industrial activities.
(ii) Action Plan with a set of measures and instruments to encourage emission reductions.
(iii) Creation of an Industry Plan Technical Commission (CTPIn) comprising representatives of the government, industry, civil society and academia, responsible for detailing the Plan’s actions, monitoring and periodical reviews.
“The Industry Plan adopts as reference a 5% reduction target for emissions in industrial processes and energy use in the industrial sector, in relation to the trend scenario (Business As Usual) projected for 2020. The target’s role is to stimulate improvements to the efficiency of industrial processes and not to hinder economic growth.”

The objective of the PIMA Air Plan was to reduce CO2‚ and NOx‚ emission and particle pollution by subsidies for renovating the commercial vehicle fleets. The main beneficiaries of this initiative were self-employed professionals and businesses, who will be encouraged to replace their old light commercial vehicles with more efficient. The Plan established the rules for the direct aid for the purchase of new and used vehicles (up to one year old) up to 3.5 tonnes maximum authorized weight. The amount of aid amounted to EUR 1 000‚ per vehicle, for vehicles of weight less than 2 500 kg and EUR 2 000€‚ for vehicles of weight over 2 500 kg. Since October 25th, 2013, electric motorcycles, scooters, and bikes were also included to this incentives program (“Plan PIMA Air 2”), with incentives up to 400 EUR, 250 EUR, and 200 EUR respectively per category. Incentives of Plan PIMA Air can be added to the MOVELE Program incentives, but not to the PIVE Program.

1. Effective global environmental countermeasures in the power industry
Since effective actions consistent with national plans and targets, are needed in the power sector, promote the development of a sector-wide framework in which;
・The goals are consistent with national plans
・Main business operators including non-regional electric utilities are participating
・Responsible body is clearly defined (focusing on retail stage)
2. Treatment of CO2 within environmental assessment
Evaluate from a stand point below where necessary and reasonable
(a) Adoption of BATs (Best Available Technologies)
・The government will identify and publish “Development and commercialization status of cutting-edge power generation technologies” by size and by fuel types, as s reference for business operators’ consideration and will request business operators to adopt BATs
(b) Consistency with national targets and plans
b-1: In relation to mid-term target：If the business operator takes actions under the sector-wide framework or plans to take measures including mitigation in abroad to offset the net increase emission over a natural gas power plant, it is judged as consistent with national targets and plans.
b-2: In relation to 2050 target：The government will accelerate development of the technologies which is targeted to be commercialized by around 2020, conduct survey on potential CO2 storage sites as a prerequisite for CCS, identify requirements for CCS Ready plants, and request business operators to study continuously including technological development in order to put carbon capture facilities towards commercialization.

he Climate Settlement is officially known as “Recommendation of the Energy and Environment Committee: Climate Settlement, Innst. 390 S (2011-2012), based on the White Paper on Climate Efforts, Meld. St. 21 (2011-2012)”. This document reinforces the targets set out in the 2008 agreement on climate policy on transportation; construction; agriculture and carbon uptake by forests; and mainland industry and petroleum activities. Some of the core measures the document recommends to be adopted within these areas include:
• Create a climate and energy fund for development of technology and industrial transformation;
• Increase the offshore supply of electric power from the mainland, while safeguarding biological diversity;
• Increase state subsidies for investment in, and operation of, municipal public transportation and other environmentally-friendly forms of transportation;
• Adopt climate measures in agriculture and carbon removals in forests through active forest management;
• Maintain or increase the forest carbon stock through active, sustainable forest policies;
• Improve incentives for the use of bio-energy derived from wood (with emphasis on forest residues);
• Increase the mandatory sale of bio-fuels to 5%;
• Tighten the energy requirements in the building code to passive house level in 2015 and nearly zero energy level in 2020.
The settlement includes three main targets:
• In relation to the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, Norway plans to exceed its commitment by 10%
• Norway plans to become carbon neutral by 2050. However, if an ambitious global climate agreement is entered into through which other industrialised countries commit to undertake large reductions in GHG emissions, Norway will bring forward this target to 2030
• By 2020 Norway plans to commit to reducing its GHG emissions to an equivalent of 30% of the 1990 emissions level (and up to 40% contingent on global action)
While emissions reductions can be carried out in Norway or abroad, the paper states that Norway will have a domestic reduction goal of two-thirds of GHG emissions.","Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Energy efficiency, Renewables, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch",,"In force",2012,,,Unknown,Mitigation,http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/law/climate-settlement-innst-390-s-2011-2012/,,,,,

It aims to achieve annual GHG emission reductions of 30 Mt by 2030 and will cover all fossil fuels (but with separate requirements for liquid, gaseous and solid fuels). The regulations for the liquid fuel class will be the first regulation published, and are expected to come into force in 2022.

The forest concession in public forests in Brazil started to be legally handled through the ""Law for the Management of Public Forests"". The costly forest concession, through the payment for the sustainable use of forest products and services, is a way of indirect management that can be applied to National Forests and other types of public forests which are not designated to community use or protected areas of ""full protection"" category. Thus allowing federal, state and local governments to grant to private actors the right to sustainably exploit the goods and services present in public forests. It is worth highlighting the fact that this law does not allow the commercialization of carbon credits and other environmental services by the owner of the concession, as explained in art. 16, 1st paragraph of section VI.
The Brazilian government currently implements a concession policy to exploit timber harvesting on national forestry reserves. The law creates a Brazilian Forest Service, sets up a National Forest Development Fund and puts into effect an infrastructure for sustainable use of public lands (including the use of concessions). The law aims to strengthen forest conservation (especially in the
Amazon) by decreasing land speculation, putting an end to fraudulent property claims (grilagem) and creating a socially inclusive, sustainable forest-based economy.

It covers two five-year periods: 2017-2022 and 2022-2027.
The NEP projects electricity demand and supply planning until the fiscal year 2026/27. It has a cumulative target of 175 GW renewable energy capacity by 2022. The NEP foresees coal-fired power capacity additions of 46 GW between 2022 and 2027.
""It is expected that the share of non-fossil based installed capacity (Nuclear + Hydro + Renewable Sources) will increase to 46.8 % by the end of 2021-22 and will further increase to 56.5 % by the end of 2026-27 considering capacity addition of 50,025 MW coal based capacity already under construction and likely to yield benefits during 2017-
22 and no coal based capacity addition during 2022-27."" (http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/committee/nep/nep_dec.pdf)
It implies that no new coal-fired power plants are necessary beyond those already under construction (Carbon Brief, 2017), and further calls of 57% of electric capacity to be non-fossil by 2027 (Carbon Brief, 2017).
Other targets: Renewable energy generation share of 20% by 2022; Renewable energy generation share of 24% by 2027.
Renewable energy sector is now poised for a quantum jump as India has reset its renewable energy capacity addition target so as to have an installed capacity of 175 GW (100GW solar, 60GW wind, 10GW biomass and 5GW small-hydro) by 2022, in view of the significant renewable energy potential in the country and commitment made by the investors/stakeholders.

The objectives of this policy are to reduce projected Brazilian emissions of GHG and to implement measures for adaptation to climate change in Brazil. The focus of this policy is to approach cross-cutting issues both on private and public sector, analysing also the social, political, environmental and economical implications. The policy also establishes the emission reduction targets for Brazil, to between 36,1 and 38,9% of projected emissions, up to 2020.

Its unconditional target is 17% below BAU levels by 2030. According to the NDC, Morocco’s GHG mitigation goals rely in large part on an important transformation of the country’s energy sector. It aims to reduce the country’s heavy reliance on foreign energy sources and increase the share of renewable energy, while responding to growing demand for energy to ensure the socioeconomic development and well-being of its citizens. The primary goals that underlie this energy transition are the following: Reaching over 52% of installed electricity production capacity from renewable sources by 2030. Reducing energy consumption by 15% by 2030. Substantially reducing public fossil fuel subsidies, building on reforms already undertaken in recent years.

The new renewable energy law establishes more ambitious national renewable energy targets that should reach 20% of total national energy consumption and 40% of total electricity consumption by 2020. Moreover, 20% of energy used in heating and cooling and 10% of energy used in transportation have to come from renewable sources. The new legislation foresees the creation of a Special Renewable Energy Investment Service that will act as an interface between public institutions and investors, annually assess the main challenges to renewable energy deployment and manage the support funding allocation process. Existing remuneration of individual residents in areas where renewable energy projects are running have been amended and replaced by a credit on electricity bills. In fact, the law establishes that a share of the RE concession taxes paid by RE producers to regional and local authorities will will be allocated to local households as a credit on their electricity bill as a way to share the benefits of living nearby a renewable energy generation plant. The renewable energy generation licensing process has also been very much fasten and eased by the regulation that entitles the Regulatory Authority for Energy (RAE) with the assessment and issuance of licences, under the authority of the ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change. The whole licensing process can not last over a 30-month period. Moreover, absolute priority is given to RES projects combined with desalination plants, when and only when the RES project is on an island and its capacity does not exceed 25% of the capacity of the desalination plant. The law also tackles the grid infrastructure challenge and implements a timely limited target for the grid utility to connect non-interconnected islands to the main grid. Still, RE projects are not granted grid priority access as grid connection will be established on a first-come first served basis until the network is saturated. The grid utility is compelled to provide grid access within four months after the connection demand has been released. The Law 3851 also establishes a whole new set of feed-in tariffs for electricity from renewable sources, to be found in the Greek FIT article.

In 2025 emissions are expected to reach between 26-28% below 2005.
To United States proposes a shift to low carbon economy and scale up offshore renewable energy. In the electricity sector, United States aims to shift towards carbon-free electricity by 2035, increase energy efficiency, scale up distinct energy sources as hydrogen and invest in carbon capture. In the transport sector the kernel is to switch petrol fuelled vehicles to zero emission ones. Also, raise efficiency standards and investments in both low carbon fuels and alternative transport modals (e.g. rail and biking). In the building sector the focuses are on the enhancement of energy efficiency of electric heating and cooking devices, for instance investing in heat pumps and induction stoves. In the industry sector the government plans to shift fuel burning processes to very low- or zero-carbon processes and to invest in carbon capture. Agriculture and land use are also target by reforestation plans, rotational grazing and forest protection to avoid wildfires.
According to Climate Action Tracker, this target would translate into 1.5-2.5 GtCO2e/yr lower emissions in 2030 below the current policies trajectory. CAT points out that this target includes LULUCF and excluding it would translate to a 43-50% reduction below 2005 levels (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

""Based on the policies stipulated in the Strategic Energy Plan, which the Cabinet approved in April 2014, METI established the Long-term Energy Supply and Demand Subcommittee under the Strategic Policy Committee of the Advisory Committee for Natural Resources and Energy in order to consider a future vision of a realistic, yet well-balanced energy supply and demand structure. So far, a total of 11 meetings on these matters have been held.
""METI has approved the Long-term Energy Supply and Demand Outlook based on the report compiled by the subcommittee.""
The energy and demand outlook for 2030 serves as de facto energy efficiency and renewable energy targets. For renewable energy, it is described that Japan will aim to increase the share of renewables in total electricity generation to 22-24% by 2030. For energy efficiency, it is described that Japan will aim to reduce its final energy use by about 10%, from 361 million kl crude oil equivalent (coe) in 2010 to 326 million kl coe in 2030.
Original title: 長期エネルギー需給見通し. For the primary energy supply, the envision structure for FY2030 is as follows: renewables 13-14%,Nuclear power: 10-11%, Natural gas: 18%, Coal: 25%, LPG: 3%, Oil 30%. For the power source mix, the structure is for FY2030 is as follows: Renewables: 22-24%, Nuclear power 20-22%, LNG: 27%, Coal: 26%, Oil 3%. Renewables are divided into: Geothermal: 1-1.1%; Biomass: 3.7-4.6%, Wind: 1.7%; Solar: 7%; Hydro: 8.8-9.2%. With a projection of economic growth at 1.7%/year, energy efficiency and conservation measures are also expected to allow a 196.1 bn kWh reduction (reduction of 17%).
Japan's INDC is developed based on this Long-Term Energy Supply and Demand Outlook.

- Increasing the steepness of the EU ETS emissions cap decrease: instead of 1.74% in the current phase the cap should decrease by 2.2% after 2020.
- Decreasing the oversupply of allowances by transferring 12% of the allowances in circulation to the Market Stability Reserve (MSR) as long as their amount exceeds 833 million. This share will be doubled in the years 2019–2023. Should the number of allowances fall below 400, an additional 100 million allowances will be released from the MSR.

This will be accompanied by new measures for the rationalization of government spending."" (http://g20.org.tr/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/g20_comprehensive_growth_strategy_saudi_arabia.pdf)
""As a first step towards greater diversification, the plan envisages raising utilisation rates of mineral resources, diversifying sector activities and developing local processing of mining raw materials. In terms of petrochemicals, this will involve developing upstream and downstream industrial activities that depend on oil and gas. Production capacity in the industrial sector will also be expanded in line with the National Industrial Strategy, with an emphasis on projects related to the diversification of energy sources away from oil. The plan aims to increase the contribution of the services sector to GDP, with an emphasis on financial, tourism, transport, engineering, communications and IT services, according to the Ministry of Economy and Planning (MEP).""

For CO2, CH4 and N2O the reference year is 1990 and for F-gases the reference year is 1995. In the reference year its emissions were 102.74 KtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) which has been decreasing during the 2000s, reaching 86,93 KtCO2e in 2018. There is no agriculture sector in the country. Monaco has set the goal to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050. For this, Monaco is setting efforts embedded in a national policy framework.
In the electricity sector, the goal is to reduce consumption of fossil fuels, so Monaco is trying to improve energy efficiency and decarbonise energy, investing in solar thermal and PV and geothermal networks. In buildings, also, the replacement of fossil fuels to biofuels is being incentivised, as well as, increasing environmental performance and energy efficiency of the buildings using sustainable codes and methods of construction and financial mechanisms for renovations. In the transport sector, Monaco focuses on the reduction of traffic and decarbonisation of the transport. A shift to other modals and public transportation is supported though electric public transportation. Lastly, the industry sector is weak in Monaco being mainly related to craft and cross sectoral measures about electricity will also cover this sector.
Market mechanisms under the article 6 is a possible outlined in the NDC to be used in the future to achieve the outlined reductions of GHG emissions (Monaco NDC, 2020).

The Norwegian Domestic Emissions Trading Scheme ran from 2005-07, and generally aligned itself with the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, covering only CO2 emissions. Industrial CO2 emitters are allocated a total amount of emissions, and reducing emissions generates credits which can be sold to other emitters needing more. The Scheme covered CO2 emissions from energy use and some industrial processes, and only covered installations not subject to the CO2 Tax (see separate entry) or special agreements on emissions reductions with the State Pollution Control Authority. According to this agreement, existing process industry plants agreed to commit themselves to a 20% reduction in all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2007, compared to 1990 levels.

• Law on Hydrocarbons (seeks to attract foreign investment to Mexico’s hydrocarbon sector, but also eliminates gasoline subsidies and promotes substitution of oil energy sources by natural gas by establishing lower tax rates for shale gas exploitation; in addition it provides for creation of ‘safeguarded areas’ where hydrocarbon extraction is prohibited)
• Law on the Electricity industry (increase share of renewable electricity, clean energy certification, planning for a smart grid)
• Law on Coordinated Regulatory Organs for the energy matters
• Law on Petróleos Mexicanos (reforms the structure and obligations of the state oil company PEMEX)
• Law on the Federal Electricity Commission
• Law on the Agency for National Industry Security and Environment Protection in the Hydrocarbon Sector (industry operations security and control of hazardous emissions)
• Law on Geothermal Energy (regulates the exploration and exploitation of geothermal energy production for electricity generation and other uses)
• Law on Revenues from Hydrocarbons
• Law on the Mexican Petrol Fund for Stability and Development (revenues from petrol extraction in Mexico, of which at least 40% annually are reserved for long-term savings “for the future generations”, while the rest can be used for investment projects not limited to clean technologies – e.g. oil development projects included)"" (Source: http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/law/energy-reform-package/)

The goal is to reach 193,73 GgCO2e. The implementation period is set to be between 2021 and 2030 and covers all GHG and F-gases.
In the electricity sector, Andorra aims to increase national production of energy to 33% (50% by 2050), being more than 75% (85% by 2050) from renewable sources. In the transport sector the country aims to reduce 50% GHG emissions, setting a binding legislation to promote electric motorized mobility or from a source low in GHG emissions. Lastly, in the building sector, the country suggests regulations enforcing that new buildings have neutral energy consumption.  
Andorra has created a national voluntary market to help the reduction of GHG.

In a first step to completely phase out fossil fuels the government targets the drop in the consumption of oil, gas and coal by 33% between 2009 and 2020.
The share of thermal production in total energy generation should also decrease from 71% to 40% over the same period.
To reach 100% of electricity from renewable, the Danish government greatly focuses on wind energy, expected to provide for 40% of total electricity needs, together with biomass and biogas. A solid district heating network, fed by renewable heat from biomass, will be the main motor of the energy transition in the heating sector.
Full independence from fossil fuels will also be reached through a solid and long term energy efficiency policy aiming at reducing gross energy consumption by 6% from 2006 levels. Energy companies will be required to increase energy savings by 50% in 2013 and 75% by 2017 to 2020. Electric meters diffusion will participate in moniotring energy demand in the residential sector.
In the building sector, the Danish government is going a step forward in implementing very ambitious building code, banning oil boilers in all new constructions and, by 2017, in all houses while biomass, biogas and solar thermal appliances will be strongly encouraged.
Denmark also targets the large scale deployment of offshore wind as well as dramatic growth in the wind manufacturing sector, and will fund research and development in for solar and wave power, support main demonstration projects for large heat pumps intended to be used in district heating plants and fund other geothermal energy research projects.
In order to generate revenues to finance the energy shift of the country, Denmark will introduce a public service obligation tax on electricity and gas, while tax on oil, gas and coal will be further increased to discourage their use.

Also, Switzerland proposes 75% of the target as a domestic share of its reduction and 25% to be achieved abroad. Besides this single-year target, the NDC also proposes a multi-year between 2021-2030 in which the country will reach an average reduction of GHG of at least 35% below 1990 emissions.
The Swiss government underscores the Energy Strategy 2050 that is yet to enter into force. In this strategy, it is foreseen an increase in renewable sources for power generation, both from hydropower (37,400 GWh) and others (reaching 11,400 GWh). 
The second approach is to halt fossil fuel subsidies, which are being reviewed at national level embedded in a normative goal of transitioning towards a low carbon economy. At international level, agreements of cooperation have been signed with other countries (Switzerland NDC, 2020).

The country pledged a reduction of 50% relative to 1990 GHG emissions by 2030 and now the pledge is at least 50% and the pledge to reach net-zero by 2050.  Moreover, according to CAT calculations, the new pledge to achieve 75% of the overall target through domestic emissions reduction can be translated into a domestic absolute target of 37.5% below 1990 levels by 2030, lacking 12.5% to be achieved internationally (Climate Action Tracker, 2021). CAT draws attention that considering the current policies Switzerland will not achieve the domestic target, with special concern in the transport sector.","Energy efficiency, Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Non-energy use, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch, Renewables",,"In force",2020,2021,2030,Unknown,Mitigation,"https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Switzerland%20First/Switzerland_Full%20NDC%20Communication%202021-2030%20incl%20ICTU.pdf

Mainly large companies situated in urban areas participated in this programme on a voluntary basis (about 20 companies during the period 1994-99) and received financial support from the Flemish Region. The Flemish government has created a ""commuterfund"". Companies and non-profit organisations which develop a mobility action plan in order to support a significant modal shift among their employees can get 50% funding of these initiatives from the ""commuterfund"" during the first 4 years. In each Flemish province a mobility desk was created, where companies can get assistance and advice on the development of their commuter plans.

The annual coal consumption should be held below 4.2bn tonnes until 2020 (16.3% more than the 3.6bn tonnes burned in 2013, according to the National Coal Association). The share of non-fossil fuels in the total primary energy mix is to rise from 9.8% in 2013 to 15% by 2020, with an indicative 20% share by 2030. The share of natural gas is to rise to above 10% (185 billion cubic meters annually), while that of coal will be reduced below 62%. In addition, installed nuclear power capacity is to reach 58GW by 2020, with additional 30GW expected to be under construction in 2020. Installed capacity of hydro-, wind and solar power in 2020 is expected to reach 350GW, 200GW and 100GW, respectively. Energy self-sufficiency should reach around 85%."" (http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/law/energy-development-strategy-action-plan-2014-2020/)
By 2020, the plan aims to have coal-bed methane production of up to 30 billion cubic meters.
Old coal units will be required to implement energy saving upgrade project, serving 600,000 kilowatts (except air-cooled units) and strives to have a drop in energy consumption to 300 grams of standard coal per kilowatt-hour over the next 5 years.
The plan aims towards strengthening building energy planning and implementation of building energy efficiency upgrade project. This should apply to 75 per cent of residential building energy efficiency design standards as soon as possible, accelerate the construction of green buildings and retrofitting of existing buildings, the implementation of public building energy consumption quotas and green building rating and labeling system, promote energy appliances and green lighting, and actively promote the construction of new energy city.
By 2020, nuclear power installed capacity should reach 58 million kilowatts and have under construction a capacity of 30 million kilowatts or more.
• The current installed capacity of hydro power is 300 gigawatts - aims for 350 gigawatts by 2020
• The installed capacity of on-grid wind power is 95.81 gigawatts - aims for 200 gigawatts by 2020

However, on 25th April 2011, the Comprehensive Plan for Implementation of the Climate Doctrine to 2020 has been approved. Some of the main actions envisioned in the Doctrine are setting a price on carbon, and enhancing energy efficiency and the expansion of renewables and alternative energy sources.
The energy targets presented in the Doctrine are: to reduce the share of energy generated from natural gas to 46% or 47% by 2030 (from more than 50% currently); doubling the capacity of nuclear power plants; increase the share of electricity produced from renewables to 1.5% by 2010, 2.5% by 2015 and 4.5% by 2020; and limit the burning of gas produced from oil wells. RE target of 1.5% by 2010, 2.5% by 2015 and 4.5% by 2020 was superseded in 2014 by the State Program on Energy efficiency and Energy Development. Followed by the Comprehensive Plan for Implementation of the Climate Doctrine to 2020.
National, regional and local authorities are responsible for producing and implementing action plans that are in line with the Doctrine, creating fiscal and financial incentives for the development and deployment of technologies that enhance energy efficiency, and lead to adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. Furthermore, the responsibility to adopt measures that lead to energy efficiency in vehicles, building, services and the production of heat and electricity rest with the enterprises themselves.

The annual decrease of allowances should be equal to 1,74 % of the allowances issued by Member States pursuant to Commission Decisions on Member States’ national allocation plans for the period from 2008 to 2012, so that the Community scheme contributes cost-effectively to achieving the commitment of the Community to an overall reduction in emissions of at least 20 % by 2020.""

The main changes are:
- A single, EU-wide cap on emissions applies in place of the previous system of national caps
- Auctioning is the default method for allocating allowances (instead of free allocation), and harmonised allocation rules apply to the allowances still given away for free
- More sectors and gases included

Croatian National Energy Strategy 2009-2020 has three basic objectives: 1) increase security of energy supply, 2) develop competitive energy system and 3) ensure sustainable energy sector development. These objectives are particularly important due to Croatia’s heavy dependence on energy imports which results in country’s vulnerability to energy prices volatilities.
Targets:
- decrease by 20% greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 taking emissions level of 1990 as a baseline;
- increase share of renewable energy by 20% in annual gross energy consumption of the country by 2020;
- cover 10% of energy consumption in all transport sector with energy derived from renewable sources by 2020;
- decrease final energy consumption by 9% by 2016.

In the transport sector, Singapore established a zero-growth rate for cars and motorcycles.
Lack of subsidies and strong pollution laws encourage industries to migrate to cleaner fuel options, and the government facilitates the adoption of energy efficient technologies through grants and other supportive policies. In the transport sector the government is promoting public transportation and greener vehicles (e.g. electric) and for the buildings sector Singapore established codes and standards, such as ‘Super low Energy Buildings Performance’ to develop and achieve a pattern of energy-efficiency.
According to CAT, the new NDC is rated 'Highly insufficient'. The NDC sets an absolute target of 65 MtCO2, which is also outlined as the peak in the country’s emission. The NDC update includes Nitrogen Trifluoride (NF3) gas, in addition to the greenhouse gases already covered (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6) (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

The Integrated Climate and Energy Policy specifies targets for reducing GHG emissions and provides a joint action plan to achieve emission reductions. The climate tax package changes to different taxes and subsidies (2MtCO2e by 2020) to balance future increases in energy and environmental taxes for enterprises and households against equivalent tax concessions, allows for a tax exemption for green cars (emissions of less than 120g of CO2/km) from vehicle tax. Furthermore the bill contains a carbon tax, which increases for heating in industry outside the scope of EU ETS such as agriculture, forestry and aquaculture (30% in 2011, 60% in 2015) and reduces the carbon tax rebate for diesel. It also facilitates green investments in developing countries, climate policy and development co-operation and an increased focus on climate change adaptation (responsibility to co-ordinate climate adaptation is given to country administrative boards; adapt spatial planning to increased risks of landslides; research on how climate change affects the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services and how negative effects can be limited).
The Integrated Climate and Energy Policy also contains action plans to promote renewable energy, improve energy efficiency and implement measures leading to a fossil-independent transportation sector.
Targets outlined in this legislation include:
– 40% GHGs from non-ETS sectors by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels)
– 50% of energy consumption from renewable energy by 2020
– 20% more efficient energy use (compared to 2008)
– 10% renewable energy in the transportation sector
– by 2020: a phase out of fossil fuels in heating
– by 2030: a vehicle fleet that is independent of fossil fuels
– by 2050: zero net emissions of GHGs in Sweden.","Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Energy efficiency, Renewables, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch, Non-energy use",,"In force",2009,,,Unknown,"Mitigation, Adaptation",http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/law/an-integrated-climate-and-energy-policy-outlined-in-government-bills-200809-162-and-200809-163/,,,,,

Viet Nam pledges 9% reduction of the GHG emissions relative to the BAU level by 2030, unconditionally. It outlines that the contribution can increase to 27% with international cooperation. The economy-wide NDC covers CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs (Viet Nam NDC, 2020).
In the electricity sector the government outlines as future actions the development of the country's renewable energy production and investment in energy saving and energy efficient production. Nevertheless, plenty of challenges are also stated such as the high upfront costs. In the building sector the government aims to incite energy efficient appliances, sustainable construction for private and public buildings and shift from conventional fuels to electricity. In the transport sector the focus is on the change of transportation modal to freight trains, reducing the usage of lorries. Also, switching conventional fuels to biofuels and natural gas.
According to CAT, the update of its NDC is rated 'Critically insufficient'. The NDC is economy-wide (including LULUCF) which sets a target of reducing 9% of GHG emissions below BAU, or 903 MtCO2e/yr. The updated conditional NDC target converts to 748 MtCO2e/yr in 2030 (excluding LULUCF). The updated conditional on international support target aims to reduce emissions 27% below the new business-as-usual (BAU) trajectory (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

The NDC covers power, transport and industry (which in the NDC covers also the building sector).
In the power sector, the Government has a financing scheme to finance alternative energy generation projects, like small scale solar and micro grids. In the transport sector the government supports switch to lower-emitting modes of transport, implementation of Mass Rapid Transit and Bus Rapid Transit and modern rail networks. Bangladesh sets an unconditional reduction to this sector of 9% below BAU.
In the industry and building sector, Bangladesh aims to achieve a reduction in primary energy consumption per GDP by adopting mitigation through building codes, standards and energy efficiency certifications (e.g. LEED).
Bangladesh has targets to increase renewable energy generation (10%) and lower energy intensity consumption. Also, some CDM projects involve the reduction of natural gas leakage from transmission lines. Lastly, in the AFOLU sector, Bangladesh plans to monitor the coverage of forest embedded in the REDD+ project.

They posited an unconditional contribution to reduce 22% of GHG emissions and a conditional contribution of up to 36% reduction below BAU, 774 MtCO2 and 638 MtCO2, respectively (Climate Action Tracker, 2020).
Mexico plans to cover all sectors. In a cross sectoral approach, the main measures outlined are Emission Trade System; Climate Finance Strategy, Circular Economy, Efficient Use of Energy. In the transport sector, Mexico aims the strengthening of regulations applicable to motor vehicles, the encouragement of alternative transportation systems, the promotion of clean transportation programs, the development and implementation of the National Electric Mobility Strategy and urban planning. In the electricity sector, it aims to increase participation of renewables, storage and smarter grids. Additionally, in the building sector the focus is on projects that optimize energy consumption in buildings and reduce the impacts of new constructions; to promote mechanisms and regulations that encourage the inclusion of best practices in constructions. Energy efficiency and circular economy are the kernel for the industrial sector.

However, from these 7%, 5% corresponds to the private sector and 2% from the public sector.
The reference year chosen is 2010 and the BAU measured is 51 milGgCO2.
The country posited 46 Mitigation options in Transport, electricity, industry, agriculture and forestry sector, and also adaptation options. The policy instruments overarch all the sectors and mitigation areas. Special attention to fuel switch and investment in renewables in electricity, transport and industry sectors. Also, codes and standards for a less demand and more material efficiency are the base for the building sector, but also present in electricity and transport. Additionally, biomass is incited as a fuel rather than fossils in the industry and agriculture sector (Dominican Republic NDC, 2020).
The main policy instruments are possible to cite the economic strategic planning (Plan DECCC-2011 and Ley-1-12) and the Climate Change National policy (Decree 269-15 – PNCC 2015). Also, in the transport sector it is planned to set codes and standards to reduce GHG emissions (e.g. resource efficiency area – new lines, new modals, low carbon tech and electric cars). In the electricity sector the efforts are to increase the share of renewables (wind, solar and PCH) and fuel switch to a less intensive. In the building sector, Dominican Republic wants to improve energy efficiency (codes and standards visioning more efficiency) and resource efficiency to reduce the demand of energy, set new standards to introduce efficient lighting for public and residential areas. In addition, in the industry sector standards will be set for the acquisition of industrial electric motors and in biomass to replace fossil fuel.  Reforestation is also envisioned by the country.

The system is based on the recommendations of the commission of experts appointed to devise an emissions trading system, although final decisions have not been made on all the issues discussed by the commission. As a general rule, the emissions quotas should be sold, but in order to avoid carbon leakage, it may be necessary to provide quotas free of charge for some industries for a limited period of time.

Costa Rica tackles several sectors, establishing goals to achieve 8% of the country's fleet with zero emissions and also 8% of electric cars by 2030.
In the electricity and heat sector, it supports renewable energy (100% by 2030). Also, codes and standards are set aiming for energy efficiency of end users’ devices and a fuel switch is promoted by a moratorium on exploration and exploitation of fossil fuels.
The building sector is tackled with codes and standards driving for a more sustainable construction and material efficiency. Moreover, in the industry sector, renewable and low carbon energy are supported to move away from carbon-based production and towards a circular economy. Fiscal, tariffs and other price instruments are the base to support the forestry sector in order to achieve 60% of forest cover in the country without jeopardising the agricultural sector (Costa Rica NDC, 2020).
According to CAT, Costa Rica’s updated NDC has unconditional targets +2°C compatible. There is room for improvement by specifying the sectoral breakdown or the contribution of the forestry sector, and also by pushing for bolder goals in order to be 1.5°C compatible. CAT calculations show that when excluding LULUCF the total emissions in 2030 will be 12.3 to 12.9 MtCO2e in 2030, though there is some uncertainty due to the forestry contribution (Carbon Action Tracker, 2021).

The law was designed to stimulate the market for renewable, clean burning fuel.
The B2 biodiesel requirement went into effect and became mandatory as of 1 January 2008. While in 2007 many gas stations began offering B2 biodiesel, all stations now offer only B2 biodiesel. The requirement was modified in March 2008, and as of 1 July 2008, the requirement is that all diesel contain 3% rather than 2% biofuel (B3 biodiesel).
The mandatory biodiesel blending content was increased as of July 2009 to 4%, and further to 5% (B5 biodiesel) as of January 2010. The B5 biodiesel requirement is being implemented three years ahead of its scheduled implementation date of 2012 as per the 2005 law.
In May 2014 the the mandatory biodiesel blending content was increased to 5% starting from 1st of Jul and 7% from 1st November 2014.
On 24th of March 2016 Law No 13.263 increased mandatory biodiesel blend target to 8% starting from March 2017 to 9% from March 2018 and to 10% from March 2019.
The targets were reconfirmed by Resolution No 11 of 14 December 2016 by CNPE.

These outcome-focused regulations apply to upstream oil and gas facilities, which are responsible for extraction, production, processing and transportation of crude oil and natural gas. The requirements target two key methane sources: fugitive emissions, which are unintentional leaks from equipment leaks, and venting emissions, which are intentional releases of methane into the air.
General requirements apply to all covered upstream oil and gas facilities:
Compressors: As of January 1, 2020, covered compressors will be required to take action to conserve or destroy methane, or else to meet applicable vent limits. If a company opts not to conserve or destroy methane, it must demonstrate compliance with the limits via an annual measurement or continuous monitoring. Corrective action is required if those emissions exceed the limit applicable to the compressor, which depends on the installation date, the type of compressor, and its rated brake power.
Well completions involving hydraulic fracturing: As of January 1, 2020, these sites must conserve or destroy gas in most circumstances instead of venting it into the air.
Conditional requirements apply to covered upstream oil and gas facilities handling significant volumes (at least 60,000 cubic metres/year of gas):
Fugitive equipment leaks: As of January 1, 2020, upstream oil and gas facilities are required to start implementation of leak detection and repair program consisting of three comprehensive inspections per year at most upstream oil and gas facilities. Corrective action is required if leaks are discovered.
Facility production venting: As of January 1, 2023, upstream oil and gas facilities must limit annual facility vented volumes of methane to 15,000 m3. These facilities would need to capture the gas and either use it onsite, re-inject it underground, send it to a sales pipeline, or route it to a destruction device. This requirement does not apply to vented gas from:
-specific temporary activities such as emergencies, liquids unloading, or equipment start-ups, shutdowns, and blowdowns;
-facilities that have vented less than 40,000 m3 in the past year without destroying or selling or re-injecting any gas; and
-processing equipment such as glycol dehydrators, compressors and pneumatic devices.
Pneumatic devices:
-Controllers: As of January 1, 2023, facilities using natural-gas-powered pneumatic controllers must ensure that on-going emissions remain below 0.17m³ per hour.
-Pumps: As of January 1, 2023, pneumatic pumps are prohibited from emitting methane where the volume of liquid being pumped exceeds 20 litres per day.

It is an economy-wide and absolute pledge, covering all sectors and gases (EU NDC, 2020).
The overarching measures in force in EU are three-folded: Emissions reduction targets under current EU legislation are divided between the sectors covered by the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS), which is put a price in the carbon and established a cap for emission allowances; by the non-ETS sectors under the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), which individual binding targets for Member States is set considering emissions not covered by the EU ETS; and land-use related emissions and removals addressed by the regulation on emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF).
Additionally, the EU passed regulations to improve energy efficiency (improve at least 32.5% by 2030), for increasing renewable energy in final energy consumption (at least 32% by 2030) and reduce CO2 emissions in the road transport sector, increasing performance (reducing emissions) of cars and lorries.
The EU agreed to reduce at least 55% GHG emissions below 1990 levels by 2030. Though this is a stronger target, it is not enough to reach 1.5°C, and a proposal between 58% and 70% is needed (European Parliament proposed 60%). Also due to methodological complexities caused by Brexit, CAT cannot rate this NDC. Nevertheless, CAT points out that the reduction would have to be between 2,324 – 2,329 MtCO2e or 52.8% (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).
CAT suggests more ambitious policy measures, which would lead to significant reductions. For instance, revise the Renewable Energy Directive based on new proposals from the ‘Fit for 55%’ package, and decrease the emissions cap of the EU-ETS, steering a coal phase-out and better performance for cars and the increase in the share of electrical vehicles.

The Plan is designed as a framework for all mitigation and adaptation efforts across the country. It builds on the UAE Vision 2021 and the UAE Green Agenda 2015-2030, along with other federal and emirate-level strategies.
To achieve these objectives, the National Climate Change Plan defines three priorities:
• Developing a national GHG emissions management system, whose objective is to establish an economy-wide emission reduction target by 2020.
• Fostering national adaptation planning ;
• Providing a private sector-driven innovative diversification Program.
Several means of implementation are also considered in the plan:
- Climate Finance,
- Capacity Building,
- Governance, Monitoring and Evaluation,
- Awareness Raising and Communications,
- International Cooperation.
The timeline of the Climate Plan extends as far as 2050, with a short-term horizon of 2020, but does not include any quantified targets.

It is based in a BAU scenario taking into account 2010 as base year.
Senegal posits its mitigation by establishing 2025 as middle point and 2030 as the end point. The numbers are as follow: (i) In the reference year, a projection of emissions to 2025 (32648,6097 GgCO2eq) and 2030 (37761,1405 GgCO2eq) were foreseen; (ii) In the unconditional scenario, Senegal proposes reductions of 5% (30987 GgCO2eq) and 7% (35106 GgCO2eq) respectivaly to 2025 and 2030 emissions; (iii) In the conditional scenario, the goals are bolder, reaching 23,78% (24883,0564 GgCO2eq) in 2025 and 25,53% (26611,0057 GgCO2eq) in 2030.
The main policy instrument to be set is the carbon market and the main sector to be tackled is the electricity and power, shifting to renewables and for less intensive fuel (e.g. from oil to natural gas) (Senegal NDC, 2020).
The country aims to go an extra mile with international aid mainly in the electricity sector, outlining an unconditional achievement of a cumulative installed solar capacity of 235 MW, 150MW in wind power, 314 MW in hydroelectricity in 2030 and presents a conditional one of an additional solar capacity of 100 MW, 100 MW in wind power, 50 MW of biomass, 50 MW of CSP, by 2030. Moreover, Senegal has a wider goal to reach 999 MW in renewable energies (conditionally) and invest to switch carbon intensive fuels to natural gas in dual thermal power stations (fuel oil / gas), which will bring the total installed 600 MW of natural gas between 2025 and 2030.

Main objective of the Algerian Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Development Plan is to expand usage of renewable energies and to diversify energy sources in the country.
Goals:
To install 22 000 MW of power generating capacity from renewable sources between 2011 and 2030 (of which 12 000 for internal usage and 10 000 MW for export);
To meet 20% of electricity generation from renewables by 2030
Renewable energy development will drive sustainable economic development of the country, increase energy security supply in Algeria and will have job-creation factor;
Solar energy (both solar PV and solar thermal) is recognized by the Algerian government as a primary renewable technology to be developed. The potential for wind, biomass, geothermal and hydropower energies is comparatively very small.
Combined, Algeria hopes to have more than 22 GW of renewable energy capacity installed by 2030, and has targeted the connection of 4.5 GW by 2020. Should Algeria hit its target, renewable energy would by 2030 account for 27% of the nations power outpout, offsetting the need for 22 GW of natural gas generation.

On 17 April 2019, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation (EU) 2019/631 setting CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and for new light commercial vehicles (vans) in the EU for the period after 2020. From 2025 on, manufacturers will have to meet the new targets set for the fleet-wide average emissions of new cars and vans registered in a given calendar year, with stricter targets applying from 2030. The Regulation also includes a mechanism to incentivise the uptake of zero- and low-emission vehicles, in a technology-neutral way. The new Regulation will start applying on 1 January 2020, when the current Regulations setting CO2 emission standards for cars and vans will be repealed.
New EU fleet-wide CO2 emission targets are set for the years 2025 and 2030, both for newly registered passenger cars and newly registered vans. These targets are defined as a percentage reduction from the 2021 starting points: 1) Cars: 15% reduction from 2025 on and 37.5% reduction from 2030 on; 2) Vans: 15% reduction from 2025 on and 31% reduction from 2030 on. The specific emission targets for manufacturers to comply with, are based on the EU fleet-wide targets, taking into account the average test mass of a manufacturer's newly registered vehicles.

It provides for the opening or extension of several coal powerplants in Safi and Jorf (planned for 2013, 2014 and 2015). It also foresees oil as a key supply in its energy mix and for its economic development, and plans to expand hydrocarbon exploration activities as a consequence.
The strategy also seeks to foster the use of renewable energy, primarily through the development of wind and solar energy. The development of renewables aims to reduce the use of fossil fuels by 2.6 Mtoe/year and to create 25,000 jobs by 2030.

This mechanism became operational with the entry into force of the Interministerial Decrees of 28/07/2005 and 06/02/2006 (I° Conto Energia)which introduced thesystem of financing for the operation of electricity production.
D.M. 19/02/2007 (II° Conto Energia)introduced some innovations such as the application of the incentive tariff on all the energy produced by the plant, the simplification of the rules on access to incentivetariffs and the differentiation of tariffs also according to the type of architectural integration and the size of the plant.
There is also a premium for photovoltaic systems combined with the efficient use of energy.
In 2010, with D.M. 06/08/2010, the THIRD Energy Account came into force,applicable to plantsthat came into operation from 1 January 2011 until 31 May 2011, which introduced specific tariffs for integrated photovoltaic systems with innovative characteristics and concentrated photovoltaic systems.
With Law No. 129/2010 (so-called ""Lawsaves Alcoa"") the 2010 tariffs of the Second Energy Account were then confirmed to all plants able to certify thecompletion of the works by December 31, 2010 and to enter into operation by June 30, 2011.
After the enactment of the Legislative Decree. 28/2011, D.M. 05/05/2011 (IV° Conto Energia)was published, which defined the incentive mechanism for plantsthat entered into operation after 31 May 2011 with the aim of aligning the level of tariffs with the evolution of the costs of photovoltaic technology and introducing an annual cumulative cost limit of incentives, set at 6 billion euros.",Renewables,,Superseded,2005,,,Unknown,Mitigation,https://www.gse.it/servizi-per-te/fotovoltaico/conto-energia,,,,,

The NDC sets an unconditional target of 95 MtCO2e by 2030. Also included 2025 as the peak year and a cap of emissions in the current decade of 1100MtCO2e.
For the LULUCF sector, Chile focuses on forest restoration, afforestation and reducing deforestation as carbon sink. The final goal is to reach neutrality by 2050.
Chile planns to strengthen its policy legal framework, exchange technology with international actors and build capacity through education at national level. Also, public-private alliances are supported by the government to finance action. In the building sector, Chile relies on targets, codes and standards and in the transport envisages to incite e-mobility and hydrogen to replace diesel. Fuel switching is also the way forward in the industry sector, from coal to electricity and biogas besides an increment in the efficiency. In the electricity sector, Chile wants to reduce GHG emission by phasing-out mineral coal, shifting to thermal and solar electrification (Chile NDC, 2020).
According to CAT this updated NDC still is insufficient to comply with Paris Agreement goals. However, this NDC is stronger than the previous, establishing 95 MtCO2e in 2030 as a wider goal, having the peak of emissions in 2025 followed by a downward trend until net-zero in 2050 and a smaller emission budget until 2030. Also, Chile establishes a target in the forestry sector.
While analysing the conditional target of up to 45% GHG emission reductions by 2030 from 2016 levels, CAT concludes that is a bolder target. However, there are no details in the NDC for a complete assessment (Carbon Action Tracker, 2021).

Energy import dependency relates to crude oil (almost 90%), to natural gas (66%), and to a lesser extent to solid fuels (42%) as well as nuclear fuel (40%).""
""EU energy security has also to be seen in the context of growing energy demand worldwide, which is expected to increase by 27% by 2030, with important changes to energy supply and trade flows.
Moderating energy demand is one of the most effective tools to reduce the EU's external energy dependency and exposure to price hikes. The current situation adds urgency to the previously agreed EU energy efficiency target of 20% that will result in 371 Mtoe primary energy savings in 2020 compared to projections.""
""Energy demand in the building sector, responsible for about 40% of energy consumption in the EU and a third of natural gas use could be cut by up to three quarters if the renovation of buildings is speeded up.""
""In March 2014, the European Council conclusions called for: ""Speedy implementation of all the measures to meet the target of achieving interconnection of at least 10 % of their installed electricity production capacity for all Member States”. Currently, the average interconnection level stands at about 8%. Taking into account the importance of interconnectors for strengthening security of supply and the need to facilitate cross-border trade, the European Commission proposes to extend the current 10% interconnection target to 15% by 2030 while taking into account the cost aspects and the potential of commercial exchanges in the relevant regions.""
""In 2012, energy from renewable sources was estimated to have contributed 14.1% of EU final energy consumption and should reach the objective of 20% in 2020. Looking beyond 2020, the Commission has proposed to increase the share of renewable energy to at least 27% by 2030.""
""Coal and lignite's CO2-emissions mean that they only have a long-term future in the EU if using Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). CCS also offers the potential to further improve gas and oil recovery that would otherwise remain untapped. Therefore, bearing in mind the rather limited uptake of CCS to date, further efforts in research, development and deployment should be made in order to fully benefit from this technology.""
""The Union's energy security is inseparable from the 2030 framework for climate and energy and should be agreed together by the European Council. The transition to a competitive, low-carbon economy will reduce the use of imported fossil fuels by moderating energy demand and exploiting renewable and other indigenous sources of energy.""

The National Energy Plan aims to install other sources of energy to achieve a diversification of the basket and ensure a reliable energy supply. The inclusion of wind power plants, photovoltaic solar generation, geothermal energy and generation from the biomass in the country's electric mix is ​​sought.
The UPME (Unit of Energy Mining Planning - Unidad de Planeación Minero Energética) identified the possible medium and long-term expansion alternatives that would allow the basket to diversify and have evaluated its impact on the system in the Expansion Reference-Generation and Transmission Plan 2014-2028. Several scenarios were presented. One of the scenarios considers the participation of more than 10% in non-conventional renewable energy in installed capacity by 2028, with a generation that ranges from 2.5% to 7.5% of total production in the period of analysis.
In the most feasible scenario, unconventional sources of energy may account for 6% of the electric energy basket, which would correspond to an installed capacity of 1,207 MW in 2028. In addition to the 474 MW of wind power in the pessimistic scenario, it is considered possible to install 143 MW of solar energy, 275 geothermal and 314 MW of biomass cogeneration.

The plan seeks to improve energy efficiency and cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by developing renewable energy and expanding nuclear power capacity. The plan aims to cut energy consumption per unit of GDP by 3-5% per year. It also aims at increasing the share of renewable energy to 16% by 2030, and transport fuel from alternative sources such as gas or biofuels to 20% by 2020. The plan contains data on the greenhouse gas emissions in the Czech Republic, including projections of future development, and presents proposals for concrete measures to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and for adaptation measures. The programme was reviewed in 2007, and the review adopted by the government in April 2008. The review pointed to significant increase in the use of renewable energy sources, as well as progress in the agriculture and water management sectors. However, it found the Czech Republics energy intensity and GHG emissions per capita were comparatively high, and that transport sector emissions continued to increase. The National Climate Change Plan is thus being reviewed to emphasise measures targeting the industry and transport sectors, which contribute the most to GHG emissions, as well as to take into account the evolution of domestic, European and global political negotiations on climate change since 2004.

During this phase, the programme will also emphasise solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies by providing installation grants for small PV systems in remote areas, as well as technical assistance and support for business development. Grants are provided for the installation of: 20, 000 Small Solar Home systems and 2, 000 large PV systems with a total capacity of around 2 MWp.

However, the targets are conditional to international aid.  The base year used in this NDC was 2011, which the net emissions calculated was 31,998.91Gg CO2e and the BAU was projected for each sector.
In the energy generation sector, Nepal proposes to expand clean energy generation from 1,400 MW to 15,000 MW, being 5,000 MW unconditionally, ensuring that 15% of the total energy demand in the country will be supplied by clean sources.  Nepal also states that 5-10 % of such clean energy will be generated from mini and micro-hydro power, solar, wind and bio-energy. (Nepal, NDC 2020)
In the transport sector, Nepal pledges that, by 2025, 25% of the sales of all private passenger vehicles will correspond to electric vehicles (including 2 wheelers), and 20% of all four-wheelers. This target will reduce 8% of the emissions compared with the BAU scenario. Moreover, by 2030 the share of sales will reach up to 90% of all vehicles and 60% considering all four-wheelers, which corresponds to a reduction of 23% compared with the BAU scenario. (Nepal, NDC 2020)
In the residential sector, Nepal focuses on the improvement of cookstoves, ensuring 25% of electric stoves by 2030 and in the installation of biogas plants (household units and large scale). Nepal aims to reduce 23% of the emissions compared with BAU. Lastly, in the AFOLU sector, Nepal relies on forest conservation (45% of the country by 2030) and sustainable management of 50% of Tarai and Inner Tarai forests and 25% of middle hills and mountain forests (Nepal, NDC 2020).
Climate Action Tracker (2021) in its own calculation compiling all BAU sectors and sectoral reductions to an economy wide one, outlined that the new conditional NDC would reduce 1.9 – 5.6 MtCO2e, leading to emissions levels between 69 - 76 MtCO2e in 2030.

The sectors covered by the target are energy (supply and demand), industrial processes, agriculture, LULUCF, and waste and the gases covered are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbon (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).
Republic of Korea underscores a plan to reduce its GHG emissions using a carbon market mechanism, the K-ETS, which covers 73.5% of national emissions. Moreover, Korea set its Korean Green New Deal focusing on green transition in cities, low-carbon energy, and innovative less carbon intensive industries.
In the electricity sector it focuses on the reduction of coal power generation through the ban on new coal-fired power plants, switching to eco-friendlier fuels. Also, Korea plans to increase the share of renewable energy up to 20% by 2030. In the industry sector the reliance lies on highly-efficient equipment which will reduce the consumption of fossil fuels. In the building sector, Korea pledges to 'greening' public buildings by upgrading standards of energy consumption. In the transportation sector, Korea has set a target of e-mobile vehicles by 2030 and a modal shift in freight transport from road to rail. All of these actions are embedded in the Korean New Green Deal plan (Republic of Korea NDC, 2020).
According to CAT, the update of its NDC is 'Highly insufficient"". The NDC is economy-wide and now has an absolute target: 24.4% below 2017 emissions by 2030. In CAT calculations, this would be equivalent to 540 MtCO2 by 2030. However, these emissions would be reached including international credits and LULUCF sink.

The plan identifies the goal of raising domestic content of core components and materials to 40% by 2020 and 70% by 2025.
Although there is a significant role for the state in providing an overall framework, utilizing financial and fiscal tools, and supporting the creation of manufacturing innovation centers (15 by 2020 and 40 by 2025), the plan also calls for relying on market institutions, strengthening intellectual property rights protection for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the more effective use of intellectual property (IP) in business strategy, and allowing firms to self-declare their own technology standards and help them better participate in international standards setting.
Although the goal is to upgrade industry writ large, the plan highlights 10 priority sectors: 1) New advanced information technology; 2) Automated machine tools & robotics; 3) Aerospace and aeronautical equipment; 4) Maritime equipment and high-tech shipping; 5) Modern rail transport equipment; 6) New-energy vehicles and equipment; 7) Power equipment; 8) Agricultural equipment; 9) New materials; and 10) Biopharma and advanced medical products.

The state targets the installation of 1 to 1.2 GW of solar capacity by 2022, seeks to enhance energy security, create jobs in the solar manufacturing and become a main exporter of renewable power to third party and neighboring states. To reach such targets, the solar policy includes a combination of support tools: First, power producers are exempted from electricity duty on the energy they consume and can apply for incentives under the Industry Scheme. Producers of solar thermal energy are granted access to the water quantity required for generation by local authorities and solar power will be guaranteed grid access under both the Indian Solar Mission and the Rajasthan Solar policy. The solar policy seeks to widespread the installation of solar water heating systems on all industrial buildings where hot water is required, large residential buildings, government and private hospitals, hotels and swimming pools. Solar steam systems in residential institutions and hospitals will also be supported. Second, the solar policy creates the RE infrastructure Development Fund to finance transmission network extension, road construction and ease the integration of RE generation. Such Fund will be financed by the collection of a development charge of INR. 10 Lacs per MW installed transfered to the Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation. The policy also provides for the regulation framework to develop solar parks larger than 1, 000 MW capacity. Such Parks will include Solar Power Plants, Manufacturing Zones, R & D and Training Centres. Third, the Solar Policy creates the Solar Research Center of excellence. The solar policy will fulfill Rajasthan s engagements in the National Solar Mission -install 66 MW of solar capacity- and install additional capacity following a competitive bidding process. Central government will tender 50 MW of solar PV and 50 MW of solar thermal and best bidders will be guaranteed a fixed price by Discoms of Rajasthan. Moreover, the policy will promote the installation of solar PV and solar thermal plans for direct sale to Discoms of Rajasthan with a maximum capacity of 200 MW by 2013 and an additional 400 MW by 2017. Eligible projects will also be selected through auctions. The state will promote off grid and decentralised solar applications and hybrid systems in replacement of diesel based generators. The solar policy also facilitates the installation of solar power producers targeting solar power trade with third party or other states.

The target status of Ukraine’s energy sector, at which the Strategy is aimed, is determined based on the need to:
• meet the population’s demand in both normal and emergency conditions;
• ensure the technically reliable and safe operation of the power supply system;
• provide for the economic efficiency of Ukrainian power supply systems and the energy sector in general;
• ensure the efficient energy use by the population and the national economy;
• find an environmentally sound solution to the environmental and climate impact of the energy sector;
• enable the state to form and implement policies aimed at protecting national interests regardless of the existing and potential internal and external threats to the energy sector.
The quantitative and qualitative targets of the Strategy are defined with due account of the need to ensure the sustainable development of the Ukrainian society in the long term, national economic priorities, and international obligations of Ukraine. The major targets for the period through 2035 are:
• to reduce GDP energy intensity by 2035 to the level of 0.17 koe per 1 USD Ukrainian GDP (PPP) and to bring this indicator nearer to that of the countries with similar climatic, geographic, and economic conditions;
• to optimize the structure of the country’s energy balance basing on energy security requirements and to bring the share of renewable energy to 20%;
• to achieve by 2020 the level of dependence on energy supplies from a single country (company) not exceeding 30% of total imports (for nuclear fuel, targets are set separately);
• to achieve by 2035 the level of dependence on supplies from a single country not exceeding 30% of the total consumption of all types of energy;
• to ensure a guaranteed compliance of generating capacities to the volumes and modes of energy consumption in the United Power System of Ukraine, particularly with regard to regulatory capacities availability;
• to ensure by 2025 the technical integration of Ukrainian and European electricity and gas markets (cross-border transmission networks) amounting to at least 15% of Ukraine’s domestic market volume;
• to form by 2035 a system of guaranteed power supplies to meet the demand of the national economy and the population during an emergency period equivalent to 90 days of consumption.

The Plan is organized along seven axes – four in the electricity production sector and three in the transport sector:
• Improving energy efficiency
• Optimal distributed electricity generation
• Sustainability of the electricity grid
• Sustainable electricity generation development
• More environmentally friendly vehicle fleet
• Sustainable public transport
• Cleaner fuels

The plan includes a set of objectives to improve energy efficiency and increase the use of renewables. All houses that are not connected to the grid should have individual photovoltaic systems by 2030. Renewable energy projects will be developed to reach 731.9 MW by 2018, additional 470 MW over the 2019-2023 period, and additional 910 MW over the 2024-2030 period.
This plan also identifies several strategic actions, policy tools, and economic instruments to achieve these objectives such as energy efficiency labeling for appliances, new efficiency standards, incentives to build efficient buildings, funding mechanisms to replace inefficient equipment, information campaigns to promote energy efficiency among the population, strategic plans for public lighting for example.","Energy efficiency, Renewables",,"In force",2015,2015,,Unknown,Mitigation,https://minae.go.cr/recursos/2015/pdf/VII-PNE.pdf,,,,,

In the electricity sector, Mongolia planned to increase the production of energy from renewable sources and improve its efficiency in the grid transmission. In the transportation sector, the major target is switch fuel (less carbon intensive) and modal. Energy saving measures and usage of coal-bed methane and waste heat are outlined as the plan for reducing emissions on the industry sector and fuel switch is also the approach in the building sector.

The Plan offers a detailed description of all existing formally approved climate change related measures for each sector (energy, industry, transport…) and cross-cutting issues (awareness-raising, exemplary role of the federal Government, etc.). The National Climate Plan also defines the 11 main axes of Belgium’s climate strategy:
• Energy production optimisation
• Efficient use of energy
• Industrial sector initiatives
• Development of sustainable transport
• Prioritisation of sustainable management of agricultural and forest ecosystems
• Continued efforts in waste management
• Increased climate change research
• Awareness-raising on climate change mitigation options
• Increased direct initiative of public authorities in reducing the GHG emissions
• Use of flexibility mechanisms (JI, CDM)
• Integrating the climate dimension into development aid policy
Climate change policy has been consolidated in the National Climate Plan (2009-2012).

The current Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy's focus is on promoting energy efficiency, energy conservation and renewable energy. It is prepared in accordance with the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act 2000 and is in force for a period of five years.
In addition to an economy-wide target to continue to achieve a rate of energy intensity improvement of 1.3 percent per annum the Conservation Strategy sets out objectives for six sectors:
Transport: a more energy-efficient transport system, with a greater diversity of fuels and alternative energy technologies
Business: enhanced business growth and competitiveness resulting from energy intensity improvements
Housing: warm, dry and energy-efficient homes with improved air quality to avoid ill-health and lost productivity
Products: greater business and consumer uptake of energy-efficient products
Electricity system: an efficient, renewable electricity system supporting New Zealand’s global competitiveness

For that, Cuba chose to use a variable reference year according to the action posited, ranging from 2014 (e.g. electricity generation based on Renewables) to 2020 (decrease of GHG in swine industry).
Some tasks are underscored, such as the urban planning, reforestation, increase the perception of population and mitigation/adaptation in core sectors.
The Specific Objective 11 and 15 are both related with mitigation practices, the former focusing on to increase energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy sources and the latter to Implement economic incentives (taxes, tariffs, credits and others) to achieve financial sustainability in the use and preservation of natural and environmental resources (Cuba NDC, 2020).
The plan encompasses all sectors (general) and touches upon all the mitigation areas analysed. A Climate Finance strategy, energy efficiency, urban planning and direct investments are measures that overarch all sectors aiming a reduction of carbon emissions. In the electricity sector, specifically, the focus is on augmenting the share of renewables and in the building in set standards, relying on solar panels both in residential and industrial areas. The novelty in this document when compared with the 2016 NDC is the inclusion of contributions on transportation, inciting a switch to less intensive or electric cars and forestry (Cuba NDC, 2020).
Cuba aims to increase 24% the energy generation with renewables by 2030 supported by direct investments from the government. Also, Cuba posits to increase energy efficiency, diminishing the use of fossil fuel in buildings and transportation by installation of solar heaters, LED lamps, induction cookers and fuel switch to a less intensive and e-mobile.
In the agriculture and forestry sector, the country posits reforestation as the main action. The commitment is to have 33% of the country covered with forest by 2030.

In 2000, it was revised and a new price at which a utility or supplier has to purchase renewable electricity from private generators was fixed. It ranges from € 0.03/kWh (for secondary biomass) to € 0.39/kWh (for PV under 5 kW). From 1999, wind electricity producers could receive either a fixed tariff of € 0.06/kWh or the average hourly market price of electricity plus a bonus of € 0.03/kWh. Rates are specified for both capacity and output credits. Output credits are the highest for wind and solar plants: € 0.07/kWh over a five-year period. Capacity credits are the highest for waste incineration plants; output credits for these plants vary depending on the size of the plant and on the relative importance of any co-fired fossil fuel. They also decrease annually. Buy-back rates for these plants are about € 0.06/kWh in the first year. Buy-back rates also depend on continuity of supply to avoid surges in power sold to the grid. The legislation also provides for guaranteed access to the electricity grid, with agreed rates for connection.

Under the 2008 Climate Change Act, the UK must meet legally binding carbon ""budgets"", committing the UK to cuts its emissions by 34% by 2020 and 80% by 2050.
The Strategy comprises three primary 2020 targets:
Over 30% of electricity to be generated from renewable energy sources, mostly from wind power, with biomass, hydro, wave and tidal power playing important roles;
12% of heat to be generated from renewable energy sources, from a large range of sources (biomass, biogas, solar, heat pumps);
10% of transport energy to come from renewable energy sources.
The key measures to achieve the targets are:
An expansion and extension of the Renewables Obligation, requiring energy suppliers to sell larger amounts of renewable energy. New measures to increase financial support for offshore wind will also be considered.
Introducing payment schemes to support the production of renewable heat and small-scale clean electricity generation by households, industry, businesses and communities.
New guaranteed payments will be provided through feed-in tariff schemes from 2010 onwards, and a Renewable Heat Incentive from 2011 onwards. Before the schemes take effect, GBP 45 million in grants have been committed.

The initiative is led by the Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) within the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).
Leaders of industrial companies are invited to take a corporate-wide voluntary Pledge to reduce the energy intensity of their industrial operations by 25% or more in 10 years. By taking the Pledge, companies are recognized as Better Plants Program Partners and, in partnership with DOE, will work to improve energy management and identify the most cost-effective options for energy and carbon savings.
The U.S. Department of Energy’s Better Buildings, Better Plants Program is an important partnership which consists of close to 160 industrial companies, representing about 2,400 facilities and 11.4% of the total U.S. manufacturing energy footprint as well as several water and wastewater treatment organizations.
In 2011, the Administration launched the Better Buildings initiative to improve the energy use for commercial, industrial, residential, and public buildings by 20% by 2020. The initiative calls on CEOs, university presidents, building owners, state and local government leaders, and residential housing developers to publicly pledge to reduce the energy use of their entire building portfolios.

""In the transport sector, the SNBC aims to achieve a 29% reduction in emissions over the 2015-2028 period, notably by improving the energy efficiency of vehicles consuming 2 litres per 100km and developing clean vehicles (electric cars, biofuels, etc.). In agriculture, the SNBC aims to achieve a 12% reduction in emissions through the implementation of the agroecology project. This will involve methanisation, ground cover, maintaining pastureland, developing the agroforestry sector and optimising the use of inputs. In the industrial sector, the SNBC aims to achieve a 24% emissions reduction, notably by improving energy efficiency, which is also a source of competitiveness, growing the circular economy (reuse, recycling, energy recovery, etc.) and replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. In the waste management sector, the SNBC aims to achieve a 33% reduction in emissions, by reducing food waste, developing the concept of eco-design, fighting planned obsolescence, promoting reuse and improving waste recovery efforts.""","Energy efficiency, Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Non-energy use, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch, Renewables",4,Superseded,2015,,,High,Mitigation,"https://www.gouvernement.fr/en/adoption-of-the-national-low-carbon-strategy-for-climate
