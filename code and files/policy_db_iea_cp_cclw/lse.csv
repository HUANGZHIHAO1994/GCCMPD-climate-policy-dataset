<br />
The decree's main purpose is to announce a National Program for Rational and Efficient Energy Use, to guarantee funding for the program in the federal budget, to name the Energy Secretary as the main authority for implementing the plan and to create a federal commission to oversee and monitor progress.<br />
<br />
This Policy stipulates that 8% of all electric energy consumption must come from renewable sources by 2016.<br />
<br />
The National Programme for Rational and Efficient Energy Use is divided into actions to be realised in the 1) short term and 2) medium and long terms.<br />
<br />
In the short term (30 days from implementation) the commission is to initiate a 'massive' public education campaign about energy efficiency, take necessary measures to manage the replacement of incandescent light bulbs with energy efficient bulbs in all private residences in the country, begin work to rate the energy efficiency of all electric appliances, improve the energy efficiency in all sectors of public administration and promote agreements with energy providers, national universities and business associations to improve energy efficiency in private sectors.<br />
<br />
In the medium to long term, the actions are further subdivided by sectors:<br />
- Industry: formulate a strategy to increase competitiveness by reducing energy costs; work to monitor and improve energy efficiency with those corporations that voluntarily participate in the programme; disseminate and replicate the program; facilitate energy efficiency technology within the private sector; offer financing to small and medium companies who voluntarily invest in energy saving technology<br />
- Commercial and Service Sectors: tailor an energy efficiency programme to the specific circumstances of office buildings, retail shops, hotels, restaurants, commercial banks etc.; develop efficiency standards for the consumption of energy (lighting, heating and air-conditioning, food storage)<br />
- Education: incorporate energy efficiency and renewable energy themes into pre-existing curricula at primary and secondary education levels; develop postgraduate programs focussing on energy efficiency at national universities<br />
- Cogeneration: develop a plan to promote and regulate the cogeneration of electricity and heat with new and existing energy providing companies<br />
- Energy efficiency standards and labelling: designate maximum and minimum standards of energy efficiency for electric appliances and machines produced or commercialised in the country; propose a timeline to ban the production, importation and commercialisation of incandescent light bulbs<br />
- Public lighting: implement system technologies to make public street lighting and traffic lights more energy efficient<br />
- Transportation: improve the management and distribution of public transportation in regards to energy consumption; with corresponding authorities develop minimum stan-dards of efficiency for new automobiles; initiate a monitoring and maintenance program for public vehicles, commercial transportation vehicles and taxis and limou-sines; design a public education campaign about the impacts of the excessive driving of automobiles<br />
- Residences: initiate a system of energy certification for newly constructed residences in co-operation with construction-industry associations, architect associations and universities; introduce energy efficiency as an indicator of construction quality in the academic departments of engineering and architecture; indicate maximum energy consumption guides for new homes based on regional geographies; optimise solar energy in new construction projects; incentivise reduction of energy consumption in existing residences; develop a strategy to design 'massive systems' of water heating using solar technology<br />
- Climate Change-Clean Development Mechanism (CDM): evaluate the role of<br />
CDM, including international carbon markets, in supporting energy efficiency projects; develop a plan to take advantage of international sources of financing and technological co-operation; promote the CDM in public and private entities that could have a role in identifying new energy efficiency projects"

The NGER Act sets out a number of thresholds in relation to GHG emissions, energy production and energy consumption. Corporations that meet an annual NGER threshold must register with the Clean Energy Regulator, and submit annual reports of GHG emissions, energy production, energy consumption, and other information. The annual reports cover the financial year (1 July to 30 June). All registered corporations are required to submit a report, even where the threshold has not been met in a given reporting year.

In better coordinating energy market reform, energy efficiency and climate policy, the Plan aims to improve national energy productivity by stimulating:<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li>""more productive consumer choices, through measures which make consumer energy choices easier, help business compete and provide more efficient incentives; and</li><br />
<li>more productive energy services, through measures which support innovation, competitive modern markets and consumer protections"".</li><br />
</ul><br />
The main measures proposed in the Plan include:<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Increased energy efficiency improvement across the residential, commercial and industrial sectors in buildings, appliances and equipment, as well as smarter management of energy</li><br />
<li>Improvement in light vehicle fuel efficiency</li><br />

<ul><br />
<li> ""encourage the additional generation of electricity from renewable sources; </li><br />
<li> reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the electricity sector; and</li><br />
<li> ensure that renewable energy sources are ecologically sustainable"" (Art 3).</li><br />
</ul><br />
These objectives are to be reached through issuing of certificates for the generation of electricity, with two types of renewable energy certificates:<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li>large?scale generation certificates, created in relation to the generation of electricity by accredited power stations; and</li><br />
<li>small?scale technology certificates, created in relation to the installation of solar water heaters and small generation units (Art 17B).</li><br />
</ul><br />
The certificates can only be issued for eligible renewable energy sources, including hydro, wave, tide, ocean, wind, solar, geothermal?aquifer, hot dry rock, energy crops, wood waste, agricultural waste, waste from processing of agricultural products, food waste, food processing waste, bagasse, black liquor, biomass?based components of municipal solid waste, landfill gas, sewage gas and biomass?based components of sewage, and any other energy source prescribed by the regulations. (Art 17).<br />
Certain purchasers (called liable entities) are required to surrender a specified number of certificates for the electricity that they acquire during a year.<br />
Liable entity is defined as ""a person who, during a year, makes a relevant acquisition (wholesale acquisition or wholesale notional acquisition - <em>author's note</em>) of electricity"" (Art 35). Exemption applies if:<br />
<br />
<ol><br />
<li> ""the electricity was delivered on a grid that has a capacity that is less than 100 MW and that is not, directly or indirectly, connected to a grid that has a capacity of 100 MW or more; or</li><br />
<li> the end user of the electricity generated the electricity and either of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the point at which the electricity is generated is less than 1 km from the point at which the electricity is used; (ii) the electricity is transmitted or distributed between the point of generation and the point of use and the line on which the electricity is transmitted or distributed is used solely for the transmission or distribution of electricity between those 2 points"" (Art 31).</li><br />
</ol><br />
Where a liable entity does not have enough certificates to surrender in a year, it will have to pay renewable energy shortfall charge. There are 2 types of renewable energy shortfall charge:<br />
<br />
<ol><br />
<li>""large?scale generation shortfall charge, which is calculated by reference to a liable entity's relevant acquisitions of electricity, its exemptions, the number of large?scale generation certificates it surrenders and the renewable energy power percentage; and</li><br />
<li>small?scale technology shortfall charge, which is calculated by reference to a liable entity's relevant acquisitions of electricity, its exemptions, the number of small?scale technology certificates it surrenders and the small?scale technology percentage"" (Art 34A).</li><br />

The most recent Commercial Buildings Disclosure Programme, updated over June-September 2016, lowered the mandatory disclosure threshold on commercial office buildings from 2,000 to 1,000 square meters. This should see an additional 1,000 commercial buildings now disclose their energy efficiency when they sell or lease their property and aims to deliver more than $50 million in energy savings, and approximately 3.5 million tonnes of emission reductions over five years. Disclosure changes will commence 1 July 2017.<br />
In relation to lowering the threshold, the frequency of required tenancy lighting assessment was lowered, to every five years instead of each year. This provision entered into effect as of September 1st 2016.<br />
Heavy financial penalties apply for non-compliance. The aim of the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act is to improve the energy efficiency of Australia's large office buildings by helping to provide buyers and tenants with credible, comparable energy efficiency information to take into account in their market decisions. An update in effect since 1 July 2015 reduces the regulatory burden on building owners and landlords and waives the requirement to provide a certificate under certain circumstances.<br />"

The strategy, in turn, consists of a set of recommendations and guidelines to be followed in defining the actions and initiatives to be implemented throughout the 2050 horizon. These, in turn, need to be defined in an Action Plan to be prepared following the approval of the PNE 2050. The document notably prioritises the expansion of hydropower capacity, of oil and gas production, the analysis of promotion mechanisms for a range of renewables, research and development, and increased efficiency.<br><br>The PNE 2030 is the first study of integrated planning of energy resources held within the Brazilian government, and prepared by the Ministry of Mines and Energy of Brazil (MME). It proposes a strategic direction for expansion of energy supply. Its estimate of future electricity needs is based on a forecast percentage growth in demand per annum corresponding to an average GDP growth per annum. The PNE is composed of a series of studies that seek to provide inputs to formulate energy policies according to an integrated view of available resources. As a contribution to meeting that future estimated demand, the MME proposes 164GW as the country's ‘exploitable, but as yet unrealised' hydropower ‘potential'. Of that 164GW, the MME says that 90% (about 147GW) is in the Amazon region. If realised, this figure would amount to more than a doubling of the total installed national electricity generation capacity in Brazil - 121GW in 2012 (from all generation sources). The PNE provides for the expansion of the electricity sector by 2030 with the use of energy sources: (1) Renewables - 191.35GW (92GW existed in 2010), (2) Conventional thermoelectric - 21.5GW (16GW existed in2010), and (3) Nuclear- 8GW (2GW existed in 2010). According to the PNE 2030, energy efficiency policy will be built in aiming at guiding a set of priority projects, to be conducted under the guidance of MME, in co-ordination with the other agents of the Government. The formulation of effective regulatory mechanisms and instruments for inspection will involve the regulatory agencies in the energy sector. The establishment of an operational structure able to manage implementing this policy also involves budgetary resources consistent with the importance of this mission.</div>"

<br />
Climate change is identified in Vision 2035 as one of the two major challenges to Cameroon's economy. Over exploitation of natural resources and environmental costs have been warned as it results in climate change threats; Cameroon is partly located in Sahel area with existing harmful effects of climate change: desert encroachment, increased temperatures, irregular seasons, sea level rise, floods, volcanism, landslides rock fall and toxic fumes. The document calls for reduction of greenhouse gases to tackle climate change as a key regional strategy for Cameroon. The Government of Cameroon pledges to seek high growth level while achieving Millennium Development Goals.<br />
<br />
Under the tentative implementation schedule of Vision 2035, drafting and implementation of major environmental policy to fight against the climate change impact is planned for the phase one (2010-2019). Climate change control is listed as one of the three specific objectives for the phase two (2020-2027). Specific actions include protecting and ensuring sustainable management of forest ecosystems, fighting desert encroachment and promoting regional projects like the Niger Basin and the Lake Chad Basin.Diversification of energy source and replacement of fossil fuel with clean energy supplies is mentioned in the document without quantitative targets."

It also delves into the country's capacity to design and implement policies, strategies and actions for adaptation and for mitigating emissions from legal, institutional and public policy perspectives. It further assesses national capacities for participating in international negotiations, meetings and reviews of IPCC reports, international and national co-operation initiatives on climate change, clean development mechanisms, and the carbon offset market, among others.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The main adaptation actions proposed are: generating local climate scenarios, determining the impacts of climate change and the corresponding adaptation measures and formulating national and sector-based plans for adaptation to climate change. Specifically, the Plan affirms the need to determine impacts on water resources, biodiversity, the forestry, agriculture and livestock sectors, hydropower generation, infrastructure, coastal zones, fishery resources and public health.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Plan calls for a national programme and sector-based plans for mitigating GHGs. The actions proposed include: designing a system to update GHG inventories; assessing the total and sector-specific potential for reducing GHGs; preparing indicators to monitor the impact of actions taken; preparing GHG mitigation plans, policies and strategies and generating mitigation scenarios for different timeframes.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The capacity building and development actions contemplated include: a national programme of education and awareness-raising; a national fund for researching biodiversity and climate change; technical and economic assessment for a climate change monitoring network; and a national registry of glaciers.</div>"

The reform opened up the spot market and guaranteed the right to be connected to the country's power grids to small generating plants, many of which fall into the NCRE category. This move increased commercial and generating opportunities for these small producers.<br />

In addition, the reform exempted projects using NCREs from paying transmission fees, using a differentiated scale—one for plants generating up to 9 MW and another for those generating between 9MW and 20MW. In addition to benefiting those sources, this exemption serves to recognise a positive externality, given their low impact on transmission grids and on invest-ments associated with their expansion."

It calls for comprehensive measures to be taken against the pollution ""caused by the burning of coal, industrial production, motor vehicles and vessels, dust as well as agricultural activities"" (Art 2.). The objective is to restrict various sources of atmospheric pollutants, including ""air pollutants and greenhouse gases, including particles, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and ammonia etc."" (Art 2.) and make information on atmospheric cleanliness more readily available to the public.<br />
<br />
The 2015 revisions provide that China should promote clean and efficient use of coal, obliging local governments to ban low-quality coal for residential use (Chapter IV, Section 1). Art 32 calls for ""measures to improve energy structure and popularize the production and utilization of clean energy; optimize the utilization of coal to be cleaner and more effective; and reduce the proportion of coal in primary energy consumption and the discharge of atmospheric pollutants during the production, utilization and transformation of coal"".<br />
<br />
The law provides for the Government to advocate low-carbon and eco-friendly transportation. ""The ownership of vehicles using petroleum fuels shall be controlled below an appropriate level in accordance with urban planning. Public transportation in urban areas shall be vigorously boosted to increase its proportion in overall transportation. The State shall adopt measures including fiscal and tax policy and government procurement to popularize motor vehicles and vessels and non-road mobile machineries that save energy, protect the environment and use new energy; to limit motor vehicles and vessels and non-road mobile machineries that feature high level oil consumption and emission; and to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels"" (Art 50). The law calls for establishment of a gasoline quality standard matched with the country's restriction requirements for major pollutants (Art 13), including sulfur, olefin, arenes and benzene.<br />
<br />
The law calls the relevant state environmental department to ""observe and simulate atmospheric conditions and use new technologies of artificial satellites, photogrammetric measurement and long-distance monitoring so as to analyze the sources and future trend of atmospheric pollution in these key areas. The department shall release such analyses to the public"" (Art 91).<br />
<br />
The law also provides greater environmental transparency to the public. It stipulates authorities of the State Council should evaluate provincial-level governments on their attainment of air quality improvement targets. The law also specifies other items to be disclosed publicly, including air quality standard, catalogue of major polluters, contact information of environmental authorities and supervisors, test results on the emissions of new vehicles, and sources and fluctuations of air pollution in important areas (Chapter III).<br />
<br />
Violations or non-compliance with the law may result in fines between 5,000RMB (USD$760) and 1,000,000 RMB (USD$ 152,000), based on severity of offense, type of entity, operation and recurrence of offense (Chapter VII).<br />
The law was originally adopted on September 5, 1987; amended according to the Decision on Revising the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Atmospheric Pollution on August 29, 1995; revised on April 29, 2000; and most recently revised again on August 29, 2015."

The Law seeks to promote efficient energy management, which comprises both energy efficiency and demand response.<br />
<br />
The Law establishes the legal framework and mechanisms to promote the use of non-conventional energy sources, and to foster investment, research and development of clean energy technologies. It seeks to set lines of action to comply with commitments made with regard to renewable energy, efficient energy management and GHG reduction, such as those acquired by approving the Statute of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).<br />
<br />
The Law allows the release of surplus energy into the network for all self-generators. Surplus energy of small self-generators that use FNCER is recognised as energy credits, which can be negotiated according to regulations issued by the Energy and Gas Regulatory Commission. The Law introduces a new classification for self-generators: small and large scale, but only in reference to the form of energy delivery that is classified as small scale by the Mining and Energy Planning Unit.<br />
<br />
This Law also allows small scale FNCER auto-generators to use bi-directional meters to be able to balance their consumption and deliveries to the grid; simple connection and surplus delivery procedures are to be put in place to enable such mechanisms to be implemented by residential users (Art 8.b).<br />
<br />
Distributed generation is also an important modification of the electricity sector. The new Law allows a generator close to consumption centres and connected to a Local Distribution System to deliver energy directly to consumers.<br />
<br />
Incentives for FNCER include those related to: (i) tax, through deductions on the investment income statement related to these purposes; (ii) tariffs, through the exemption from payment of import duties on machinery and equipment for this type of generation; and (iii) accounting, where an accelerated depreciation on assets is permitted.<br />
<br />
The Law provides for the establishment of a Non-Conventional Energy and Efficient Energy Management Fund (FENOGE), which may finance all or part of the programmes and projects for the residential sector, at levels 1, 2 and 3, as long as they involve small scale, self-generation solutions and promote energy efficiency and good practice. On September 16th, 2017, the Ministry of Mines and Energy issued decree n. 1543 that modifies the rules established by decree n. 1073/2015 and further details the scope, organisation and financial means of FENOGE.<br />
<br />
UPME and CREG are responsible for issuing regulations applicable to FNCER, establishing new self-generation schemes, and setting price signals. The Law provides the government 12 months to issue such regulations."

<br />
CONPES 3700 recommended the creation of SISCLIMA as the official national institution to coordinate and propel climate change actions. Within these actions, SISCLIMA will co-ordinate the implementation of the four climate change priority strategies defined by the government: CCNAP, CLCDS, ENREDD+ and the Strategy for Fiscal Protection Against Natural Disasters. It is expected that these strategies will need to formulate their own financing strategy and to add a component for private sector investment.<br />
<br />
The proposed approach is one whereby climate change initiatives will be built through a bottom-up approach. Four permanent committees at the base of the SISCLIMA structure will coordinate, shape and implement sectoral and territorial policy as well as international affairs for climate change adaptation and mitigation based on detailed technical studies carried out on specialised working groups. The Finance Committee (FC) will act as coordinator of financing activities and offer support to those initiatives seeking financial support by directing efforts to identify and coordinate sources of finance available at the national and international levels. Finally, at the very top of the system, the Inter-Sectoral Commission on Climate Change (COMICC) will bring together various ministries and key national institutions to co-ordinate and direct institutional efforts on climate change and act as the connection point between SISCLIMA and the wider government, including the presidency. COMICC will also share findings and guide policy at the highest level of the national government on climate change issues. The final structure however is still under revision.<br />
<br />
A Presidential Decree is required to give effect to CONPES 3700. At the time of writing (November 2014) this has not been issued and meanwhile successive drafts of the REDD+ Readiness Preparation Proposal (R-PP) have introduced further refinements. For example, CONPES 3700 envisages that SISCLIMA will be directed by an Executive Committee (COMECC). The latest drafts of the R-PP have sought to make SISCLIMA's governance more inclusive; COMECC has now become an Inter-Sectoral Committee (COMICC)."

A Constituent Assembly was established in 2007; it drafted the current Constitution and got internal approval of it by July 2008. In September 2008, the draft constitution was approved in national referendum by a majority of 63.93%.

It covers a large scope of economic activities and brings in binding energy targets for transport, housing sector and renewable energy. In its 215 articles, the law sets the following ambitious national targets:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>cut GHG emissions by 40% between 1990 and 2030 and by 75% by 2050;</li><li>cut the national energy usage by at least 50% by 2050;</li><li>reduce the share of fossil fuels in energy production by 30% compared to 2012;</li><li>cap the total output from nuclear power at 63.2 GW and reduce France's reliance on nuclear power from the current 75% to 50% by 2030;</li><li>bring the share of renewables up to 32% of the energy mix by 2030.</li></ul><div><br>&nbsp;The law also increases the carbon tax on fossil fuel more than four times, from the 2015 rate of 14.5 euros to 56 euros per ton in 2020, and 100 euros in 2030, pending on ratification in the annual budget.<br>&nbsp;Renewable energy production is supported through simplified administrative procedures for onshore wind farms (art 143) and general permitting process for renewables (art 145). In addition, powers have been given to municipalities to develop district heating and cooling systems (art 194).<br>&nbsp;The adoption of the law is expected to create more than 75,000 new jobs in the housing sector through retro-fitting the ageing housing stock (which currently consumes about 50% of France's energy).<br>&nbsp;The law sets minimum energy consumption requirements for public buildings and, where possible, requires them to be energy positive. Minimum energy requirements applicable to social housing are extended from collective dwellings to individual housing (art 13). Energy upgrades or integration of renewable energy sources can also be mandated through local plans (art 8-I). Government support for energy upgrades is maintained (art 14-II and art 22) and the installation of smart meters is mandated by law (conditions apply - art 27) Administrative procedure for energy upgrades of communal parts of buildings is simplified, by recognizing simple majority voting among tenants (art 14-I). Similarly, procedures for building certification are simplified by allowing for certification at delivery of the new built (art 15). Individual billing for heating and electricity consumption are required in all buildings fitted with a collective heating and/or hot water system (art 26).<br><br>&nbsp;The law also contains a package of measures to tackle air pollution through a clean transport programme, which incentivises citizens to buy low-emission vehicles by installing approximately 7 million charging stations and dedicated parking places. The law also requires the State to prioritise electric and low-carbon vehicles in procurement (at least 50% of new procurement). Taxi and rental companies will also have to reach a minimum of 10% of low-carbon vehicles in their vehicle park. A subsidy for replacing old diesel vehicles by new ones is also provided, with a dedicated capped budget. In addition, metropolitan areas are allowed to reduce traffic speed on all or part of the city routes (art 47) and introduce temporary traffic bans against polluting vehicles across the city (art 49). Additional measures include: price reductions for access to public transport in case of traffic ban for certain type of vehicles (art 48); penalties for removing particulate filters (art 58); and optimal urban planning of the transport system contributing to reduction of air pollutants (art 66).<br><br>&nbsp;The law sets a requirement for investors to declare the environmental impact of their investment portfolios, including specific reference to impact on climate change. Article 173 imposes listed companies to disclose financial risks related to the effects of climate change and measures adopted by the company to reduce them; banks and credit providers shall disclose the risks evidenced by the stress-tests that are regularly implemented in their mandatory risk reports; and institutional investors must disclose information to beneficiaries on how their investment decision-making process takes social, environmental and governance criteria into consideration (including climate risk), and the means implemented to contribute to the financing of the ecological and energy transition. Several other educational and financial assistance projects are to be commissioned to assist citizens with energy efficient retrofits, renewable sources installation and others.<br><br>&nbsp;The law also promotes waste reduction and resources savings, in particular a gradual decoupling between France's growth and consumption of raw materials. The laws includes the following provisions:<br>&nbsp;</div><ul><li>increase by 30% over 2010-2030, the ratio of the GDP to domestic material consumption;</li><li>decrease the domestic material consumption per capita (consumer products, food waste, electronic waste) and increase recycling rates (art 70-V, art 84, art 87, art 99 and 103);</li><li>the production, distribution, sale, provision and use of packaging or bags made wholly or partly from oxo-fragmentable plastic (biodegradable but not compostable) are prohibited;</li><li>as of 1 January 2016, disposable plastic bags available at supermarket counters are prohibited, and from 1 January 2017, the ""fruit and vegetables"" plastic bags are prohibited (art 75);</li><li>as of 1 January 2017, the use of non-biodegradable and non-compostable plastic packaging for sending addressed or non-addressed press and advertising is prohibited ;&nbsp;</li><li>state services and local authorities are to decrease their office paper consumption by 30% before 2020;</li><li>as of 1 January 2017, at least 25% (40% as of 1 January 2020) of paper products, stationery and fiber-based prints acquired by state services and local authorities and their groupings are to be made from recycled paper, with the rest to come from sustainably managed forests;</li><li>strengthened powers for mayors to deal with abandoned vehicles (art 77);</li><li>better monitoring of waste (art 82) and fight against chemical waste trafficking (art 77-IV) and unregulated waste disposal (art 78);</li><li>other quantified limits apply to State and local authorities construction work waste and raw materials use.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>The law also aims to support protection of biodiversity and pollution reduction, in particular through mandated reduction of free sale of pesticides for home-gardeners (from 1 January 2016) and then phase-out from 1 January 2017, and ban on aerial spraying of pesticides, except in cases of serious health hazard (art 68).</div>"

Half of this target is to be achieved by the CHP law, the other half by a voluntary agreement with industry. Renewable energy technologies not covered by the EEG may benefit from this law, including co-firing of biomass in fossil-fuelled power plants and biomass-fired CHP larger than 20MW. The premium cannot be combined with other support, particularly not with the EEG.<br />
<br />
In the original (2002) act, only the CHP share of the quantity of electricity produced was subsidised, which was fed into the grid at all voltage levels for general supply. With effect from 1 January 2009, CHP electricity that is fed into non-public grids or is used for self-supply is also subsidised. Subsidies for new heat networks or expanding heat networks were also included.<br />
<br />
The 2009 amendment aims to increase electricity generation from CHP plants by promoting the modernisation and construction of CHP plants, support for the fuel cell sector and the funding for the construction and expansion of heating and cooling systems, and the construction and extension of heat and cold storage capacity. With the amendments in 2008 and 2009, the percentage share of high-efficiency CHP plants in electricity and heat generation (primary energy use over 90%) will be increased from 12% to 25%. District heat networks will also be expanded."

The Greek Public Power Corporation (PPC) holds the exclusive rights for the production, transfer and distribution of electricity throughout the country. However, the Minister of the relevant department (now the MEECC) can authorise individual producers (natural or legal entities) to produce electricity at power stations which belong to them (as opposed to those which belong to the PPC), introducing thus for the first time an element of energy market liberalisation, applicable for the generation of electricity for installations up to 50MW. These natural or legal entities can either produce electricity for personal use (self-producers) or they can sell it to the PPC (independent producers).<br />
<br />
Individual energy producers can use renewable sources, such as wind power, solar power, biomass, geothermal resources and hydropower. Addressing energy consumption, the legislation adopted a fixed feed-in price for renewables of roughly 90% of the household electricity rate. The law also sets general provisions for the licensing and function of power stations, the pricing of electricity production from individual producers and the technical and economic terms for contracts between individual producers and the PPC. The Centre for Renewable Energy Sources and Saving is set to be the national centre for the co-ordination of all the activities related to renewable sources of energy."

The Act stipulates that at least 10% of energy for transport must be produced from renewable sources by 2020. It sets the specific sustainability criteria and certification process necessary to fulfil the prescribed quota of biofuel. A 2013 amendment relaxed reporting obligations on fuel traders from monthly to annual. This Act is often referred to as the ?Biofuels Act? as it widely addresses the promotion of biofuel use to reduce GHGs.

<br />
The provisions of the Act applies to generation, transmission, distribution, trade and consumption of electricity; the operation of the electricity grid and ancillary services; establishment, operation and decommissioning of electrical installations, customer connection systems, consumer equipment and direct lines; and licensing in the electricity sector. This Act is framed in the belief that utilization of renewable energies and waste as fuel shall be promoted in order to protect the environment and nature.<br />

The strategic objective of the EU stipulates a 13% increase in renewable energy capacity by 2020. The NREAP supersedes and overwrites the preceding target and renewable energy policy, and aims to increase renewable energy within the total gross energy consumption by 14.65% by 2020. In addition, there is a target of renewable energy accounting for 4.3% of gross final consumption of energy in 2005.<br />
<br />
The NREAP identifies significant potential in renewable energy sources, but many of them face environmental concerns as barriers and funding limitation. Some 16-17MW of hydropower could realistically be installed by 2020, but environmental concerns are limiting factors. Wind energy potential reaches several thousand MW, while also considered environmentally friendly, but it needs economic justification as it is highly intermittent. Geothermal energy potential in Hungary exceeds the global average but lack of funding is a significant barrier. Solar energy potential amounts to several tens of thousands of MW, but the most significant limiting factor is large investment cost. Heat pumps have theoretical potential of several hundred PJ, but face funding limitations. Biogas production potential in theory could exceed as much as 20% of energy demand for 2020. Biofuels have significant potential, but are limited by the financial burden of replacing current vehicles. The target trajectory of renewable energy by end use in 2020 is to increase to: 18.9% of heating and cooling; 10.9% of electricity; and 10% of transport.<br />
<br />
The NREAP provides that the following will be financed: green economy development, research and development, adaptation to use of green electricity, biofuel benefits, tariffs and tax issues. It also aims to formulate incentives through regulatory and comprehensive programmes on sustainable energy management, renewable energy, simplification of authorisation procedures, establishment of regional energy agencies, and review of energy certification procedures for buildings. Social measures such as employment, national and regional training, social awareness-raising and network of energy experts are among the planned measures outlined in the action plan. Specific laws and programmes in question and associated details are included at the end of the NREAP."

General objectives and priorities of the period between 2008 and 2025 are set, and the strategy is to be implemented by the National Climate Change Program (NCCP).<br />
<br />
The NCCS is structured as following: framework for the elaboration of the climate strategy; mitigation of climate change; adaptation to the changing climate; and implementation of the strategy. The reduction target for 2025 is reduction by 16% to 25% from the 1990 level in case of a unilateral 20% reduction by the EU, or 27% to 34% from the 1990 level in case of a conditional target reduction of 30% by the EU. The implementation phase first addresses adoption of a National Climate Change Programme (NCCP) for a two-year period. Monitoring is applicable to NCCS and also the NCCP, which is to be prepared by a set of indexes that reflect the climate change efficiency of the economy or the carbon reduction (e.g. GHG emission per GDP, emission per capita, energy intensity).<br />
<br />
The NCCS identifies three major directions of actions for the long term climate change policy: to comply with EU and international requirements in order to reduce GHG emissions by reducing overall energy use; to fight against the unfavourable ecological and socio-economic effects of the inevitable climate change and improve adaptability to climate change impacts; and to raise social awareness of climate change. The government prepares annual reports on the progress of implementation of the NCCS to Parliament.<br />

The 2014 NEAAP acknowledges that the substantial savings in the last three years. The key message from these figures is that Ireland has achieved 12,337GWh (primary energy equivalent) by end-2012, which represents 39% of the national target. Progress is also steady with respect to the 33% target set for the public sector. Nevertheless, the mix of energy policy measures across the various sectors of the economy will be kept under constant review and adapted as necessary to ensure they are contributing the energy savings required to meet the 2020 objectives."

A key output from the OREDP is the identification of ways to ensure the optimal coordination of a wide range of government departments, agencies and state bodies that are critical enablers for offshore wind and ocean energy development. The Plan identifies the next steps that must be taken to support the sustainable realisation of the economic potential of offshore renewable energy resources.<br />
Taking into account a number of energy, economic development and environmental issues, the Plan identifies ten policy and enabling actions, along with responsible bodies and completion timeframes, which are key to the development of the offshore renewable energy sector: (i) put in place a robust governance structure; (ii) increase exchequer support for ocean research, development and demonstration; (iii) introduce initial market support tariff for ocean energy; (iv) develop renewable electricity export markets; (v) develop the supply chain for the offshore renewable energy industry; (vi) communicate that Ireland is open for business; (vii) explore potential for international collaboration; (viii) introduce a new planning and consent architecture for development in the marine area; (ix) put in place a number of mitigation measures to protect the environment; and (x) ensure appropriate infrastructure development."

Its objective is to guide a transition to a low carbon energy system, which provides secure supplies of competitive and affordable energy to our citizens and businesses. Ireland's energy policy addresses three core objectives: sustainability, security of supply, and competitiveness. It also addresses the need for affordable energy for domestic and business consumers.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the energy sector will be reduced by between 80% and 95%, compared to 1990 levels, by 2050, and will fall to zero or below by 2100.<br>&nbsp;Ireland's 2020 renewable energy target is to increase the share of national energy consumption made up of renewable energy sources (RES) to 16%. This target is broken into three key sectors with individual targets for each sector: 40% of electricity supply (RES-E), 12% of heating (RES-H), and 10% of transport (RES-T). Ireland also has a target of a 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020.<br>&nbsp;Renewable energy and improved energy efficiency will play vital roles in reducing emissions. Decisions about the development and deployment of new technologies will inform the renewable energy mix and impact on the role of citizens as energy consumers.<br><br>&nbsp;By 2030, the Better Energy Programme will deliver enough deep energy efficiency upgrades to put the residential sector on a realistic trajectory to a low carbon energy future.<br>&nbsp;Consumers will drive the transition by, for example, choosing to use less energy, adopting lower carbon options for transport and heating shifting energy use to o -peak times or investing in smart home technologies.Stable, transparent, evidence-based, and independent regulation is essential to facilitate competition, to support investment, and to ensure that the cost of capital and network costs are minimised.<br>&nbsp;The SEM is in the process of being reformed and regulators are working to implement the new I-SEM market by 2017.

It also names institutions that shall pursue the analytical and managerial tasks needed to finance the transition, amend laws and take other measures to reach the overall emissions and efficiency targets.<br>&nbsp;<br> The Plan gives directions to reducing electricity consumption via setting up an advisory team to the Finance Minister and the Accountant General to consult on the objective of granting NIS 500 million over ten years for investment loans in energy efficiency and greenhouse gases emissions reductions. The grants program in energy efficiency will be operated by the Investment Centre and the National Authority for Technology and Innovation. The decision stipulates that grants will be awarded on a competitive basis over the economic performance of emissions reduction per unit of electricity saved. The Ministry of Finance alone shall allocate a budget of NIS 300 million.<br>&nbsp;<br> The decision tasks the Ministry of Energy to: 1) provide a multi-year plan for energy efficiency for 2030, 2) evaluate how to reduce electricity consumption, 3) amend the law accordingly to institute a mechanism for generating units of energy saved (Negawatts) in energy supply and demand, and to use electricity bills as a clearinghouse for repayment of loans, taking into consideration financial exposure of electricity providers. The decision also charges the Finance Minister in concentration with the Energy Minister to consider an update in tax policy regarding the deprecation for energy-saving products. Photovoltaic commercial facilities in particular will be granted a tax benefit in form of an accelerated depreciation at a 20 % rate over a three-year period.<br>&nbsp;<br> In terms of energy efficiency in buildings, the Plan urges the Energy Minister, the Environmental Protection Minister, the Construction and Housing Minister, and the Finance Minister to evaluate how to update the Energy Sources Law of 1989 to establish energy ratings for new residential buildings and offices based on Israeli Standard 5282. The Housing and Energy Ministers must explain how to achieve the emissions reduction target of of 5.9 M tCO2e by 2030 in the building sector, notably by 1) increase the number of new buildings built under the country's principal green building standard, SI 5281, and 2) assess technical means.<br>&nbsp;<br> Other measures in the Plan include a confirmation of the governmental efforts to achieve a 10 % target for electricity generation from renewables by 2020, in accordance with Government Decision 4450 of January 2009.</div>"

This is equivalent to 22-23% of primary energy consumption, while fossil fuel use will fall from 86% to 76%. Renewables will become the primary source in the electricity sector together with gas, accounting for 34-38% of consumption (compared with 23% in 2010).<br>6) Primary consumption will fall by about 24% by 2020 compared with the reference scenario (an estimated 4% below 2010 levels); this exceeds the European 20-20-20 targets of -20%, thanks mainly to energy efficiency measures.<br><br>&nbsp;To attain these results, the strategy formulates seven priorities, each with specific supporting measures already set in motion or currently being defined:<br>1) Fostering Energy Efficiency<br>2) Promoting a competitive gas market, integrated with the other European markets and with aligned prices<br>3) Developing renewable in a sustainable way, in order to exceed the European targets (\20-20-20\), while at the same time keeping energy bills competitive<br>4) Developing an efficient electricity market fully integrated with the European market; with gradual integration of renewable power production<br>5) Restructuring the refining industry and the fuel distribution network, to achieve a more sustainable system competitive on the European level<br>6) Sustainably raising national hydrocarbons production, which will bring major economic and employment benefits, while observing the highest international standards in terms of security and environmental protection<br>7) Modernising governance of the energy sector to make decision-making processes more effective and more efficient<br>8) Research and development will play a key role in developing technologies that allow for a more competitive and sustainable energy system<br><br>&nbsp;The NES lays down long-term indicative objectives for 2050. Among the most important:<br>1) The need to strengthen efforts in energy efficiency. Primary consumption will have to fall in the range of 17-26% by 2050 compared to 2010, by decoupling economic growth from energy consumption. In particular, efforts in building and transport will be critical<br>2) The high penetration of renewable energy, than in any of the scenarios envisaged at the time is expected to reach levels of at least 60% of gross final consumption by 2050, with much higher levels in the electricity sector. In addition to the need of research and development for the reduction of costs, it will be fundamental to rethinking the market and network infrastructure<br>3) A substantial increase in the degree of electrification, which will almost double by 2050, reaching at least 38%, particularly in electricity and transport<br>4) The key role of gas for the energy transition, despite a reduction of its weight both in percentage and in absolute value in the span of the scenario</div>"

It required Italian energy producers and importers (producing or importing more than 100 GWh/year from conventional sources) to ensure that a certain quota of electricity fed into the grid comes from renewable energy sources, aiming at a general reduction of CO2 emissions of about 4Mt - 6Mt by 2006.<br />
<br />
A 2% quota obligation was set, strengthened in 2003 and again in 2008. Producers and importers can comply with the obligation by means of green certificates. They can buy those certificates through bilateral contracts or by participating in the green certificates platform (managed by GME, the energy markets operator).<br />
<br />
Suppliers can fulfil the obligation by buying green certificates from eligible new renewable energy plants, by building new renewable energy plants or by importing electricity from new renewable energy plants from countries with similar instruments on the basis of reciprocity. Renewable energy producers in operation before 31 December 2007 can obtain green certificates for 12 years. Subsequent regulatory interventions have increased the incentive period to 15 years."

Energy defined under this Law covers energies derived from oil, natural gas, coals, heat (fossil-derived) and other sources of energy derived from the above. Electricity derived from renewable sources such as solar PV, wind and biomass are not subject for this Law. Designated businesses are required to produce reports (regular reporting for Factory II, both regular and mid-term reporting for Factory I) to the Energy Agency of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. The purpose of this is to report amount of fuel, heat and electricity used in the subject period. Reduction target of 1% on average is set out under the law, with a fine up to JPY1m (USD8,495) according to the violation.<br />

It sets the principles on the use of market mechanisms to encourage a secure and more environmentally friendly supply of energy. It provides that the State has a responsibility to create overarching energy plans ('Strategic Energy Plan', or 'Basic Energy Plan') and commit to reducing environmental impacts. The role of subnational governments is to implement the national measures in own jurisdiction.<br />
A Strategic Energy Plan sets out basic energy measures, long-term and comprehensive measures and research and development needed to achieve the above. The Plan is sent to discussion and adoption by the Diet, and to date four plans have been adopted (October 2003, March 2007, June 2010, April 2014).<br />
The Fourth Strategic Energy Plan (April 2014) added safety into the basic policy perspective, on top of the 3 elements ('the 3Es') mentioned in the previous plans: energy security, economic efficiency and environment (collectively known as '3E+S'). Diversification of energy sources and flexible and efficient energy demand structure are the two basic pillars of energy policy, reflecting the learning from the 2011 energy crisis. Promotion of resilient energy supply structure and improvement of self-sufficiency of energy supply are emphasised as national interest for energy policy.<br />
In particular, the Fourth Strategic Energy Plan sets the following targets:<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li> Efficient lighting equipment (e.g. LED lighting and organic EL lighting): target ""penetration rate of 100% on a flow basis by 2020 and on a stock basis by 2030"" (page 39)</li><br />
<li>Low-emission vehicles: target increase in the ""ratio of next-generation vehicles to all new vehicles to 50%-70% by 2030 while promoting comprehensive measures, including steps to improve traffic flow such as the development of loop routes and other trunk road networks and introduction of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), which will contribute to energy efficiency' (page 40)</li><br />
<li>Storage batteries: promote introduction by ""lowering their cost and improving their performance through technological development and international standardization so that Japanese companies related to the storage battery business will capture a share of 50% in the global storage battery market (20 trillion yen) by 2020' (page 76)</li><br />
<li>Fuel cell vehicles: ""promote installation of hydrogen refuelling stations, targeted increase in the share of next-generation vehicles to 50-70% of all new vehicles by 2030' (page 68)</li><br />

In addition, the General Electricity Law grants authority to the Electricity Sector Regulatory Commission to provide incentives (not specified in the law) to encourage improved technological efficiency; and to participate in the regulation of efficiency standards for electric devices officially issued by the Standards and Meteorology Corporation.<br />
<br />
Previous additions to the law passed in 2002 allowed private energy companies to access to the electricity grids as well as set guidelines for renewable energy projects. Large-scale projects (above 5MW) would be contracted through competitive tendering (no longer necessary due to the provision in the renewable energy law), small-scale (below 5MW) through direct negotiations and very small scale (below 1MW) for auto-generation and only to be bought during peak demand."

<br />
The law was a necessary step in order to realise the reduction in GHG emissions, increasing the share of renewable energy (defined as solar, wind hydropower, biomass, and geothermal energy) consumed relative to fossil fuels. The law does not, however, specify a percentage share of renewable energy.<br />
<br />
The text lays the legal framework to develop national and regional programmes to exploit renewable energy, establish norms associated with renewable energy production, and issue permits for new projects and plants. This regulatory authority will rest in a government-authorised body (of the executive branch) in charge of all renewable energy programmes.<br />
<br />
At the regional and local levels, the Authority both authorises local executive authorities to participate in the planning and approval of local and regional projects to develop renewable energy up to 25MW and obliges them to reserve and allocate local lands to said projects, within the framework of the law.<br />
<br />
Renewable energy prices are set by the provider but must not exceed the estimated price stated in the feasibility study submitted to and approved by the appropriate governing body. Those companies operating regional power grids are legally obliged to buy all renewable energy produced by plants connected to the grid up to 50% of their total energy purchases. Should renewable energy exceed 50% of energy purchased by companies operating regional energy grids, the national grid shall purchase the surplus in its entirety. Additional incentives to develop renewable energy projects include prioritising the connection of renewable energy plants to energy grids and the use of renewable energy once those plants have access to the grids, and the exclusion of 'service payments' associated with the sale and purchase of traditionally produced energy.<br />
<br />
This law codifies the requirement that by 2024 5% of Kazakhstan's total energy consumption must come from renewable sources."

It includes provisions related to climate change and an amendment passed in 2011 allows Kazakhstan to operate a national carbon trading scheme.<br />
<br />
It states that the state shall prioritise prevention and mitigation of climate change and regulate according to principles that limit the amount of GHGs released into the atmosphere. The law authorises a governmental body to monitor climate change and ozone layer and further charges that body with using scientific information to develop measures at the national level specific to various economic sectors to reduce the discharge of GHGs into the atmosphere.<br />
<br />
The law also outlines the regulatory authority of the state of Kazakhstan to issue limits (quotas) on the emissions of GHGs and ozone-destroying gases. The regulatory authority lies with a government body to be specified by the state, which will determine maximum quotas, and issue permits for the import of substances harmful to the ozone. The details of the carbon trading scheme were not included in the amendment but issued in a series of executive decrees."

It establishes the basis for the creation of institutions, legal frameworks and financing to move towards a low carbon economy. As a General Law, it specifies the different responsibilities of the Federation, Mexico's pledge under the Copenhagen Accord, in terms of committing the country to an emissions reduction target of 30% below Business As Usual (BAU) by 2020, subject to the availability of financial resources and technology transfer, as well as 50% GHG emissions reduction by 2050 compared to 2000. <br><br>The Law transforms the National Institute of Ecology into the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC). The INECC will be responsible for compiling the National Emissions Inventory, will collaborate in the development of strategies, plans, programmes, instruments and actions related to sustainable development, the environment and climate change, and will help in the evaluation of national climate change policy. Through the Law, the Inter-ministerial Commission on Climate Change (IMCC), initially created by presidential agreement in 2005, is now formally the institution in charge of co-ordinating climate change government actions and formulating and implementing national adaptation and mitigation policies. The GLCC also establishes the National Climate Change System, formed by the IMCC, the INECC, state and municipal governments and representatives of Congress. Its main responsibility will be to co-ordinate the efforts of the Federal Government, states and municipalities. <br><br>Taking into account Mexico's vulnerability to climate impacts, the Law puts a strong emphasis on adaptation measures. The objective is to reduce social and ecosystem vulnerability by strengthening the resilience of natural and human systems to reduce damage and risk. One of the tools to achieve this is the 'Risk Atlas' which includes information about current and future vulnerability scenarios. The GLCC states that the national mitigation policy should include diagnosis, planning, measurement, reporting, verification and assessment of national GHG emissions. The national mitigation strategy will be implemented gradually; initially promoting the strengthening of national capacities and subsequently beginning mitigation activities in the most cost-effective sectors - energy production, transport, agriculture, forests and other land use, waste and industrial processes. <br><br>The GLCC also creates a climate change fund, which will channel public, private, national and international funding projects that simultaneously contribute to adaptation and mitigation actions, such as supporting state-level actions, research and innovation projects, technological development and transfer, and the purchase of Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs). The Law establishes a voluntary market for emissions trading to promote GHG reductions in a cost-effective, verifiable, measurable and reportable manner. The National Climate Change Policy, the Special Programme on Climate Change, and the Special Programme on the Use of Renewable Energy lay down details for the implementation of the Law. <br><br>The law was amended in 2014 to establish a tax on fossil fuels, and in 2016 at article 94 to frame a carbon market.

According to the law, the Secretariat of Energy (SENER) should promote generation of clean power to reach the levels set forth in the Climate Change Act for the electric power industry, including: a minimum share of clean energies in power generation of 25 % by 2018, 30 % by 2021, 35 % by 2024.<br />
SENER is also responsible for establishing obligations for mandatory acquisition of clean energy certificates that the suppliers and qualified users participating in the wholesale power market and the holders of interconnection agreements must comply with on an annual basis. The issuance of clean energy certificates (CECs) is expected to begin from 2018 and will serve both as a green incentive and a regulatory mechanism to meet the country's clean energy goals. A transitory provision, valid for four years, allows companies to defer 50 % of their CEC acquisition obligation for two years under specific conditions.<br />
The law also establishes the National Commission for Efficient Use of Energy (CONUEE), tasked with promoting energy efficiency, providing scientific advice in matters of clean energy, and drafting the Energy Strategy that sets medium and long term goals (15 and 30 years horizon respectively) as well as the National Programme for Sustainable Use of Energy (PRONASE - Chapter V of the Energy Transition Act), the two main implementation tools of the law.<br />
The law further establishes a Smart Grid Programme to promote grid modernization to maintain a reliable and secure infrastructure to meet electricity demand in an economically efficient and sustainable manner.<br />

The law prioritises the development of renewable sources in order to promote energy security, access to energy, sustainable development, reduction of GHG emissions, reduction of deforestation, and integration/harmonisation of Morocco's renewable energy production with other Euro-Mediterranean markets.<br />
Originally passed in 2010, the latest version from December 2015, introduces a net metering scheme for solar and wind power plants connected to the high-voltage grid, and in the future also those connected at the middle and low-voltage level. In particular, the law calls for regulation detailing the conditions for investors in solar-PV to benefit from opening of the low-voltage grid to renewable power installations. Private investors in renewable power in general will be able to sell their surplus output to the grid, but no more than 20 per cent of their annual production. The exact terms and conditions of the net metering scheme will be set by regulation.<br />
The law further regulates the electricity sector and creates an authorisation/declaration system, depending on the capacity of the facility: a declaration is required if an electricity generating facility capacity is between 20kW and 2MW; an authorisation is required if an electricity generating facility capacity is equal to or higher than 2MW. In respect of facilities that produce thermal energy, there is only a declaration if the capacity is equal to or higher than 8MW.

By establishing this market, producers and suppliers of electricity were able to offer electricity on a market.<br />
<br />
On April 9, 2018, the Energy Transition Act (wet VET) was adopted to amend the 1998 document and the Gas Act. The objective of this Act is to make the uptake of renewable energies in the country easier by reviewing extensively and in much detail the previous legal framework.<br />
<br />
The Act allowed for distribution companies and large consumers could buy electricity from generators other than the local one. While the Act limited large-scale production to the existing generators, it also allowed self-generation by industry and CHP production by industrial firms or by joint ventures involving distribution companies. The Act forced distribution companies to take in all electricity that was locally generated and supplied to them, and to pay a feed-in tariff essentially equal to the avoided costs.<br />
<br />
The E-Act also established, as of August 1, 1998, DTe, the independent regulator for the energy sector, as a chamber of the Dutch competition authority NMa. DTe was charged with supervising the sector and had the responsibility to guarantee non-discriminatory access to the grid for generators and to regulate the prices of the captive end users. The law forced energy companies to split their tariffs into network tariffs (including systems services) and tariffs for energy use as of the year 2000. DTe regulated the network tariffs and the final tariffs of the captive users, with the law imposing an RPI-X formula and the '1996=2000 principle' stating that overall prices in the year 2000 could not be higher than those that prevailed in 1996.<br />
<br />
As of 1 April 2014, the regulation for the feed-in tariff (SDE+) for 2014 has opened. This regulation includes the following features: a budget ceiling is established for all types of renewable energy such as wind, geothermal, solar photovoltaic, biomass and hydro phased opening a ‘free category' to enhance investments in certain technologies; feed-in tariff granted for a certain period (5, 12 or 15 years); a maximum subsidy amount for the Netherlands, to be determined annually (EUR3.5bn, USD5.4bn in 2014).<br />
<br />
Since its introduction in 1998 several amendments have been made to incorporate new elements such as the transposition of EU Directives. Several changes have been introduced in the E- Act in 2010, such as smart metering and congestion management rules for electricity) in order to improve the Dutch energy market.

To this end, the Act authorised the Minister of Finance to manage New Zealand’s holdings of units for GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol and to trade them on international carbon markets. Furthermore, the Act designated a national inventory agency. The Agency is charged with recording and reporting information relating to GHG emissions in accordance with New Zealand’s international requirements. <br><br>The Act has been amended numerous times, most recently by the<strong> Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act</strong> in November 2019: The Zero Carbon amendment sets a target to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. It also sets targets for biogenic methane emissions (from agriculture and waste) - 10% by 2030 (compared with 2017 levels), and 24%-47% reduction by 2050 (compared with 2017 levels). 5 year rolling carbon budgets are set, and obligations set to monitor meeting of those budgets. By 2024, a review will be carried out with regards to inclusion of emissions from international shipping and aviation in the 2050 target. The amendment mandates carrying out a periodic national climate risk assessment, and sets obligations on government to follow every assessment with a national adaptation plan. The amendment establishes a Climate Change Commission which serves an an independent advisory board to government. The Commission's role is to provide independent, expert advice to the Government mitigation and adaptation, and to monitor and review the Government’s progress towards its emissions reduction and adaptation goals. The Zero Carbon amendment sets consulting obligations with Māori and iwi leadership bodies under the obligations of the Treaty of Waitangi on multiple aspects of the law. Previous amendments: The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times. <br><br>The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS.

They will be phased out at 1.3 percent rate starting from 2016. The Act also stated that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries.<br> <br> The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Forestry Sector) Amendment Act 2009 made technical amendments to the forestry sector's participation in the NZ ETS, specifically, giving the Minister in charge the ability to withdraw or suspend draft allocation plans, and changing the timeframes for the surrender of units in relation to pre-1990 forest land activities.<br> <br> The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 amended the Climate Change Response Act 2002 to introduce a GHG emissions trading scheme in New Zealand (known as the NZ ETS). The Department of Inland Revenue specifies how the Climate Change Response Act amends the Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to cover the income tax consequences to the forestry sector and the GST consequences to all sectors of transactions in emissions units.<br> <br> The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2006 made numerous small changes to the 2002 Climate Change Response Act such as identifying an expiry period for both temporary and long-term certified emission reduction units, allowing the Governor General to make regulations establishing forest sink covenants, and adding principles of cost recovery such as via levies or fees.<br><br>On June 22nd, 2020, the <a href=""https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_92847/climate-change-response-emissions-trading-reform-amendment"">Emissions Trading Reform Amendment Act</a> was passed amend the 2002 Act.

The ultimate goal envisioned is for Pakistan to be one of the 10 largest economies in the world by 2047. The following pillars of the vision meet elements of the millennium development goals (MDGs) and sustainable development goals (SDGs):<br />
- People first: developing social and human capital and empowering women<br />
- Growth: sustained, indigenous, and inclusive growth<br />
- Governance: democratic governance - institutional reform and modernisation of the public sector<br />
- Security: energy, water and food security<br />
- Entrepreneurship: private sector and entrepreneurship-led growth<br />
- Knowledge economy: developing a competitive knowledge economy through value addition<br />
- Connectivity: modernising transport infrastructure and regional connectivity.<br />
<br />
While the overall direction of the document is development of the country, climate change is considered as one of the challenges the country would face that requires mitigation and adaptation. Pakistan's vulnerabilities are seen as an important challenge of its transition towards a high level of sustained growth. Following vulnerabilities and challenges are mentioned in the document:<br />
- Water security: current water availability is less than 1,100 cubic meters per person, down from 5,000 cubic meters in 1951; Pakistan's water storage capacity is limited to 30 days<br />
- Food security: Pakistan ranks 76th of the 107 countries on the Global Food Security Index<br />
- Glacial melt: Indus basin (water reservoir) affected by the glaciers in the Hindukush-Karakoram and Himalayas<br />
- Biodiversity threat caused by climate change: habitat destruction and alteration, biotechnology (such as basmati rice, turmeric and neem) and threats of genetically modified seeds and germplasm to indigenous species<br />
- Energy security: alternative energy<br />
- Institutions that favour the status quo<br />
- Infrastructure bottleneck.<br />
<br />
The Vision 2025 stands upon the target fulfilment of the MDGs and SDGs by 2030. The document also sets out 25 goals in accordance to the 7 pillars. The goals that are related to the purpose of this study are as follows:<br />
- Double power generation to over 45,000MW, to provide uninterrupted and affordable electricity<br />
- Increase access to electricity from 67% to 90% of the population<br />
- Improve generation mix (15%) and reduce distribution losses (10%) to reduce average cost per unit by over 25%<br />
- Increase the share of indigenous sources of power generation to over 50%<br />
- Address demand management by increasing usage of energy efficient appliances and products to 80%<br />

The Policy provides a comprehensive framework for the National Action Plan for adaptation and mitigation.&nbsp;<br><br>The objectives of the new policy are to pursue sustainable economic growth with a series of measures that appropriately address the challenges of climate change. These measures should integrate climate change policy with interrelated national policies. It is intended that policies should focus on pro-poor and gender-sensitive adaptation while also promoting mitigation. There is an explicit acknowledgement of the risks posed to water, food and energy security posed by climate change; and the need to minimise the risks from the increased frequency and intensity of events like floods and droughts.&nbsp;<br><br>The policy seeks international finance to support the development required to meet these numerous challenges. However, in addition to directly seeking finance, the policy seeks to create economic incentives to encourage public and private sector investment in adaptation measures and the promotion of conservation of natural resources and long-term sustainability. All relevant ministries, departments and agencies will have to devise their own plans and programmes to implement policy provisions relating to their sectors. Similarly, the lower levels of government, provincial governments; the regions of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan; federally administrated territories and local governments are expected to establish their own strategies, plans and programmes for NCCP implementation.</div>"

It acknowledges the multiple functions of Pakistan's forests, such as carbon storage for climate change mitigation. However, there is a particularly strong focus on forests' role in mountain areas where they provide protection from soil erosion and reduction of downstream siltation; and crucially, watershed protec-tion. It also notes the potential of forests to support local livelihoods in terms of provision of non-timber forest products (mushrooms, medicinal plants etc.).

Much of Pakistan's forests have now been cleared, increasing the importance of managing what remains under a framework of sustainable use. In particular the sustainable use should benefit marginalised groups such as women and children. Use of existing resources should be complemented with forest restoration activities to attempt to regenerate forests in order to safeguard economic growth.

Approaches to achieve the desired sustainable use of forests include the substitution of firewood and timber (specifically discouraging the use of rare species in government buildings); and the prevention of encroachment on remaining forest lands through regulation of grazing.

In order to finance the protection of watersheds and safeguard Pakistan's water supply, the forest policy stipulates the creation of a forest fund. The fund may also be used to finance the promotion of forestry research and education in Pakistan.

<br />
The need for the NSDS is stark since the country faces a series of significant challenges: Growth rates are currently largely coupled to resource and natural material use, leading to continued environmental degradation. This has contributed to increasing water scarcity, a significant problem given that storage capacity and water efficiency delivery is low. In the energy sector, thermal efficiency is low, distribution losses are high, and power cuts are reported to be a common frustration for domestic and business users. In addition, strategic energy reserves are low. These problems are set against a backdrop of high poverty and illiteracy rates in addition to increased impacts of natural hazards, notably the impact of disastrous flooding.<br />
The three core programme areas addressed are:<br />
? Economic: Sustainable trade, Cleaner Production, and Sustainable Consumption<br />
? Environment: Natural capital and Biodiversity<br />
? Social: Social protection, poverty alleviation and equal opportunity/human development.<br />
<br />
The strategic goals of the programme are to:<br />
- Promote green investment and green jobs<br />
- Improve eco-efficiency by changing production and consumption systems<br />
- Internalisation of environmental costs into pricing<br />
- Develop sustainable infrastructure focusing on transportation and communication<br />
- Develop demand for sustainable consumption among consumers through awareness raising<br />
- Account for depletion of natural resources in national accounts<br />
- Promote efficient use of energy and water, including through improved watershed management and reforestation<br />
- Improve biodiversity management and increase forest cover; prepare lists of endangered species<br />
- Deliver basic services of acceptably high quality to all citizens. These would cover 10 years of schooling, healthcare, food, water, shelter and energy<br />
- Ensure preparedness for natural and human-made calamity and emergencies through mitigation and integration of disaster contingencies in broader development strategies."

This Act requires electric service providers to make a net metering program available to customers by which customers may establish a renewable energy-powered customer generation system to produce electricity for their own use and to supply excess electricity to the electric service provider. The Act requires the electric service provider to offset charges for electricity by the amount of electricity supplied by the customer from the customer generation system and requires the electric service provider to give the customer credit for electricity generated by the customer that exceeds the amount supplied by the electric service provider. It requires the customer to meet certain safety requirements with respect to the customer generating system. It prohibits the electric service provider from imposing additional charges or fees to customers participating in a net metering program.

Through net metering, Palau hopes to 1) encourage investment in renewable energy resources, 2) stimulate economic growth, 3) reduce demand for electricity when alternative energy is available, 4) enhance the continued diversification of the energy resources used in Palau, 5) reduce fossil fuel imports for electricity generation and increase energy independence, and 6) reduce carbon emissions.

Acknowledging the Philippines' vulnerability to climate change, the Framework's vision is 'to build the adaptive capacity of communities and increase resilience of natural eco-systems to climate change, and optimise mitigation opportunities towards sustainable development'.<br />
<br />
On renewable energy, it states a target of doubling renewable energy capacity from 4,500 MW to 9,000 MW in the next 20 years<br />
<br />
The mitigation pillar leans on managing energy demand, via energy efficiency and conservation programmes, and on energy supply, via use of low-carbon and renewable energy resources, targeting a doubling of renewable energy capacity by 2030. It encourages low-carbon transportation modes (LPG, bio-fuels) and sustainable, energy-conserving infrastructure building. The infrastructure emphasises the importance of REDD+ policies as a measure to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Waste management and methane collection are also included in mitigation priorities.<br />
<br />
The Adaptation pillar includes enhanced vulnerability and adaptation assessments, eco-system management (river basin management, coastal and marine systems, biodiversity); water management; climate-responsive agriculture; climate-responsive health sector; climate-proofing infrastructure; and disaster risk reduction.<br />
<br />
The synergy between mitigation and adaptation is emphasised, and cross-cutting strategies are portrayed, among others capacity building in all level of governance, knowledge management and education; research and development and technology transfer.

A unit substitution fee is set to a constant 300.03 PLN/MWh (2014 level, approx. 72 €/MWh), which should stabilise the price of certificates, as purchasing and redeeming of certificates of origin will only be allowed if the average market price of certificates remains below 75% of the substitution fee.</li></ul></li></ul><div><br></div><div>The Act also introduces a feed-in tariff system for micro installations of up to 10 kW (max 40 kW under special conditions - art. 41.7), while guaranteeing purchase by electricity distribution companies at 100% of market price for the next 15 years, until no later than December 31, 2035 (art. 41.5).

This Strategy also constitutes the document being sent to the UNFCCC according to Portugal's international commitments. The document materialises the government's 2016 pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by the end of the period. The strategy explores the feasibility of trajectories that lead to carbon neutrality, identifies the main vectors of decarbonisation and estimates the reduction potential of the various sectors of the national economy, such as energy and industry, mobility and transport , agriculture, forests and other land uses, and waste and wastewater.<br><br>The resolution sets as an objective, for the purposes of the previous number, the reduction of GHG emissions for Portugal between 85% and 90% by 2050, compared to 2005, and the compensation of the remaining emissions through the use of soil and forests, to be achieved through a emission reduction trajectory between 45% and 55% by 2030, and between 65% and 75% by 2040, in relation to 2005.<br><br>The document details the following vectors of decarbonisation:<br>a) Decarbonise the production of electricity, eliminating the production of electricity from coal by 2030 and proceeding with the total decarbonization of the electricity system by 2050, betting on endogenous renewable resources;<br>b) Implement the energy transition, significantly increasing energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy, investing in the incorporation of endogenous renewable energy sources in final energy consumption, promoting electrification and adjusting the role of natural gas in the national energy system;<br>c) Progressively decentralize and democratize energy production, giving emphasis to the role of the consumer as an active part of the energy system;<br>d) Promote decarbonisation in the residential sector, favoring urban rehabilitation and increasing energy efficiency in buildings, promoting progressive electrification of the sector and the use of more efficient equipment, and combating energy poverty;<br>e) Decarbonise mobility, favoring the mobility system in public transport, through its strengthening and decarbonization of fleets, supporting innovative and intelligent solutions for multimodal, active, shared and sustainable mobility, as well as electric mobility and other technologies zero emissions, together with a reduction in the carbon intensity of sea and air transport, focusing on innovation, efficiency and cleaner, renewable fuels, as well as the decarbonisation of short- and long-distance transport of goods, promoting a logistical chain with a modal split that minimizes the carbon and energy intensity of the transport system, reaffirming the role of maritime and fluvial transport in conjunction with rail freight;<br>f) Promote the energy transition in industry, the incorporation of low carbon production processes and industrial symbiosis, promoting innovation and competitiveness;<br>g) Betting on sustainable agriculture, through the significant expansion of conservation agriculture and precision agriculture, substantially reducing emissions associated with livestock and the use of fertilizers and promoting innovation;<br>h) Foster carbon sequestration, through active agricultural and forest management, promoting the valorization of the territory;<br>i) Changing the paradigm of using resources in production and consumption, abandoning the linear economic model and moving to a circular and low carbon economic model;<br>j) Prevent the production of waste, increase recycling rates and very significantly reduce the deposition of waste in landfills;<br>k) Streamline the participation of cities and local administrations in decarbonisation, encouraging an integrated approach to its different vectors, in particular mobility, buildings, services and waste management, and enhancing the role they have been playing in mitigating climate change;<br>l) Stimulating research, innovation and knowledge production for neutrality in the various sectors of activity;<br>m) Make taxation an instrument for the transition to neutrality, proceeding with the elimination of environmentally harmful subsidies, reinforcing the application of the carbon tax and promoting greater taxation on the use of resources, recycling revenues for decarbonization and fair transition ;<br>n) Redirect financial flows to promote carbon neutrality, namely by promoting the development of a favorable framework for sustainable financing and greater involvement of the financial system, as well as the respective monitoring;<br>o) Promote the involvement of society in the transition, contributing to increase individual and collective action, the adoption of sustainable behaviors and the alteration of production and consumption patterns in favor of sustainability, namely through environmental education and awareness;<br>p) Promote the development of skills and (re) qualification directed towards new opportunities for economic development;<br>q) Encourage the development of the new economy linked to energy transition and decarbonisation, supporting the development of new industrial and service clusters, and the generation of new business opportunities;<br>r) Promote a

Under the Law, all energy resources produced, transmitted, and consumed are subject to compulsory accounting by virtue of the respective meters.

The Law contains energy efficiency rules for circulation of goods (energy efficiency classification of goods, labelling, prohibition of non-efficient incandescent bulbs etc.). It establishes a general rule that buildings and other structures should meet applicable energy efficiency requirements both when being commissioned and during their subsequent operation. State construction supervisory authorities shall assign energy efficiency classes to apartment buildings.

The Law sets the conditions for voluntary or mandatory energy audits and encourages energy-saving technologies including, but not limited to, the use of secondary energy resources and renewable energy sources.

State programmes aimed at energy savings and energy efficiency increases are expected to set such targets as the number of facilities relying on secondary energy resources or renewable energy sources for their energy supplies.

Instruments: Tax incentives include investment tax credits of up to 30% for companies investing in energy efficiency technologies, accelerated depreciation of high energy efficiency assets or sites and partial compensation of interest on loans granted by Russian banks for the purpose of investing in energy saving and increased energy efficiency technologies.

Seventeen Decrees of application will be adopted by the government (covering such issues as energy efficiency requirements for goods, including electric bulbs, buildings and constructions, energy efficiency classes of goods and apartment buildings, requirements for public procurements, requirements for regional and municipal programmes in the sphere of EE1, etc.)."

Its main targets relate to: strategic infrastructure investment for exports; more private sector financing to increase exports; urbanisation; and a green economy approach to sustainability. Five priority areas will spearhead this thematic strategy.<br />
<br />
Priority 1 is to increase the domestic interconnectivity of the economy by investing in infrastructure to meet private sector energy demand; increasing access to public goods and resources in priority sectors; and deepening the integration of key value chains.<br />
<br />
Priority 5 is the pursuit of a ‘green economy' approach to economic transformation, favouring the development of sustainable cities and villages. Key innovations include: piloting a green city; piloting a model mine; and attracting investors in green construction. There will be a focus on green urbanisation and promoting green innovation in industry and the private sector. A Green Urbanisation Centre of Excellence and an Environment and Climate Change Innovation Centre will be created. The Environment and Climate Change Centre will promote transformational green innovation in the industrial and private sectors through (i) support to research and development through links to industry and academia in Rwanda and internationally; (ii) promoting technology transfer in priority sectors through business advice and training; (iii) linking innovation with finance through identifying international funding sources (e.g. FONERWA); (iv) providing analyses and information on market and sector trends.<br />
<br />
Environment and climate change are considered ‘cross cutting issues'. They involve (i) mainstreaming environmental sustainability into productive and social sectors; (ii) reducing vulnerability to climate change and (iii) preventing and controlling pollution. Key sectors include agriculture, energy, environment and natural resources, infrastructure, health, private sector and financial sector.<br />
<br />
EDPRS II supports the previous target of increasing forest cover to 23.5% by 2012 and reset a new indicator to reach 30% by 2018. In addition, it recommends for sustainable management of forest biodiversity and critical ecosystems through protection and maintenance of 10.25% of the land area, and reduction of wood energy consumption from 86.3 % to 50% by 2020 as reflected in the 2020 Vision targets."

<br />
The Objective of this strategy is to ensure that environment and natural resources are utilised and managed productively in support of equitable and sustained national development and poverty reduction. This will be realized in 5 specific objectives : (1) To increase and sustainably manage ecosystems and forest resources to optimize their economic as well as ecological functions; (2) To put in place and operationalise an efficient system of land administration and land management that secure land ownership, promote investment in land for socio-economic development and poverty reduction; (3) To ensure that development in Rwanda is undertaken in a manner that inflicts minimal damage to the environment, and building resilience to threats posed by climate change for the sustained support to economic, social and cultural development of Rwanda. (4) To secure and provide water of adequate quantity and quality for all social and economic needs of the present and future generations with the full participation of all stakeholders in decisions affecting its management; (5) To improve the Geology and Mines sub-sector to contribute optimally and sustainably to the national income and to the social economic welfare of the community.<br />
Environment and Climate Change will contribute to the achievement of EDPRS II through the following innovations: ecosystem rehabilitation based on job creation and income generation for rural poverty reduction and social protection; integrating innovative approaches and knowledge on technology transfer on irrigation, renewable energy and agro-forestry; developing and implementing an incentive structure to award performance in environmental management; and operationalize FONERWA fund.<br />
<br />
The Five Year Strategic Plan for the Environment and Natural Resources Sector establishes targets of forestry to increase forest cover, with districts measuring their success against new forest planted, targeting a minimum of 83 trees per household in rural area and 5 trees in urban areas, with a survival rate of 90%. It also targets the number of climate change adaptation and mitigation projects to be developed and implemented between 2013 and 2018.<br />
Environment and Climate Change priorities will be implemented by Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA) whereas Land, Forestry, Water resources and Mining will be executed under the mandate of the Rwanda Natural Resources Authority (RNRA)."

It seeks to transform Rwanda into a middle-income country by the year 2020. This will require achieving annual per capita income of USD900 (USD290 today), a poverty rate of 30% (64% today) and an average life expectance of 55 years (49 years today).<br />
<br />
The framework includes the rehabilitation and development of infrastructure as a crucial aspect in lowering the costs of doing business. It calls for: (i) a modern land law providing security of tenure and freedom of exchange; (ii) the development of alternative lower costs of transport to the sea; and (iii) increase of energy production and diversification into alternative energy sources. Rwanda has considerable hydroelectric potential, in addition to large deposits of renewable methane gas in Lake Kivu, estimated at 60bn m3. In rural areas direct solar energy or photovoltaic energy can be used, whilst up to 1/3 of 155m tons of peat deposit is currently exploitable. Rwanda projects that by 2020, at least 35% of the population will be connected to electricity (up from the current 6%).<br />
<br />
Vision 2020 recognises sustainable environmental and climate change management as a cross-cutting pivotal area to the realisation of national aspirations. It recognises that the major problem in environmental protection is the imbalance between the population and the natural resources. This leads to alarming degradation observed through massive deforestation, the depletion of biodiversity, erosion and landslides, pollution of waterways and the degradation of fragile ecosystems.<br />
<br />
To protect the environment against massive deforestation and soil destruction, Vision 2020 sets the target for the protection rate against erosion to rise from 20% in 2000 to 90% by year 2020. To ease the pressure on wood biomass seeing that 86.3% of the Rwandan population uses wood as the source of energy, Vision 2020 targets to drop the use of wood energy in national energy balance, to 50% by 2020 through diversification of energy sources availed to the population."

It reiterates the country's pledge, first made in 2009, to reduce emissions by 16% below 2020 business-as-usual levels if there is a legally-binding global agreement in which all countries implement their commitments in good faith. Ahead of this, Singapore has embarked on policies and measures that will reduce its emissions by 7% to 11% below 2020 BAU levels.<br />
<br />
The strategy identifies accelerated coastal erosion, higher incidences of intense rain or prolonged drought, biodiversity impacts, and disruption to food and other supplies as potential climate change impacts facing Singapore. It reiterates the country's commitment to a multilateral approach to dealing with climate change, and argues that a global approach will be more conducive towards Singapore's long-term growth and development. It highlights Singapore's position on a global climate agreement as one that supports the UN model of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.<br />
<br />
The strategy outlines three key principles that guide Singapore's response to climate change:<br />
- Long-term and integrated planning;<br />
- Pragmatically and economically sound measures; and<br />
- Developing innovative solutions for Singapore and global markets.<br />
<br />
It also identifies four main approaches that Singapore will follow in addressing climate change:<br />
- Reducing carbon emissions in all sectors;<br />
- Being ready to adapt to the effects of climate change;<br />
- Harnessing green growth opportunities; and<br />
- Forging partnerships (e.g. with international and regional bodies).<br />
<br />
The document contains chapters on the importance of climate change and Singapore's national circumstances and constraints, as well as detailed chapters on both mitigation and adaptation plans and policies.In terms of mitigation, energy efficiency is the country's core strategy (given the country's limited access to renewable energy opportunities). Specific identified strategies to reduce emissions across different sectors include:<br />
- Power generation: switching fuel mix away from fuel oil to natural gas;<br />
- Water: incinerate sludge rather than dispose in landfills;<br />
- Households: extend minimum energy performance standards to lighting and other appliances;<br />
- Buildings: require Green Mark certification for all new buildings;<br />
- Transport: implement carbon emissions-based vehicle scheme to encourage purchase of low carbon emission cars; and<br />
- Industry: develop and support energy efficiency financing pilot schemes.<br />
<br />
The strategy identifies coastline protection, addressing flood risks, and managing water resources as the three key adaptation priorities of Singapore, and also focuses heavily on green growth as a development model. Finally, it outlines the various local and international partnerships (e.g. with other countries/cities) that Singapore is engaged in."

GHG emissions are set to stop increasing at the latest by 2020-2025, to stabilise for up to 10 years and then to decline in absolute terms.<br />
<br />
Strategies are specified for the following areas:<br />
- Carbon Pricing<br />
- Water<br />
- Agriculture and commercial forestry<br />
- Health<br />
- Biodiversity and ecosystems<br />
- Human settlements<br />
- Disaster risk reduction and management<br />
<br />
The policy has two main objectives: first, to manage inevitable climate change impacts through interventions that build and sustain social, economic and environmental resilience and emergency response capacity. Secondly, to make a fair contribution to the global effort to stabilise GHG concentrations in the atmosphere.<br />
<br />
The Policy specifies strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation, making use of the short-, medium- and long-term planning horizons (up to five years from publication of policy, up to 20 years, up to 2050, respectively). The White Paper outlines a risk-based process to identify and prioritise adaptation strategies and interventions that have to be taken in the short and medium term, while reviewed every five years.<br />
<br />
Concerning mitigation, it includes proposals to set emission reduction outcomes for each significant sector and sub-sector of the economy based on an in-depth assessment of the mitigation potential, best available mitigation options and a full assessment of the costs and benefits using a 'carbon budgets' approach. It also proposed the deployment of a range of economic instruments, including the appropriate pricing of carbon and economic incentives, as well as the possible use of emissions offset or emission reduction trading mechanisms for those relevant sectors, sub-sectors, companies or entities where a carbon budget approach has been selected.<br />
<br />
Energy Efficiency and Energy and Demand Management flagship programmes cover development and facilitation of an aggressive energy efficiency programme in industry, building on previous Demand Side Management programmes, and covering non-electricity energy efficiency as well. A structured programme will be established with appropriate initiatives, incentives and regulation, along with a well-resourced information collection and dissemination process. Local governments are encouraged to take an active part in demand-side management.<br />
<br />
There is a short-term transportation flagship programme, which aims to facilitate the development of an enhanced public transportation programme to promote lower-carbon mobility in five metros and in ten smaller cities and create an Efficient Vehicles Programme with interventions that result in measurable improvements in the average efficiency of the vehicle fleet by 2020. The planned rail recapitalisation programme is considered an important component of this Flagship Programme due to its projected contribution to modal shifts of passengers and freight. The programme further introduces a Government Vehicle Efficiency Programme that will measurably improve the efficiency of the government vehicle fleet by 2020, by setting procurement objectives for efficient technology vehicles such as electric vehicles.<br />
<br />
In the medium term, the plan calls for significant up-scaling of energy efficiency applications in transportation; and for promoting transport-related interventions including transportation modal shifts (road to rail, private to public transport) and switches to alternative vehicles (e.g. electric and hybrid vehicles) and lower-carbon fuels.<br />
<br />
The principles of the White Paper include prioritising co-operation and the promotion of research, investment in and/or acquisition of adaptation, lower-carbon and energy-efficient technologies, practices and processes for employment by existing or new sectors or sub-sectors. All fields and flagship programmes include a key element of research and development, data collection and analysis tools in their respective areas.<br />
<br />
Adaptation efforts are prioritised, acknowledging the vulnerability of the country. Adaptation efforts will require: early warning and forecasting for disaster risk reduction; medium-term (decade-scale) climate forecasting to identify potential resource challenges well in advance; and long-term climate projections that define the range of future climate conditions. Adaptation strategies are to be integrated into sectoral plans, including: The National Water Resource Strategy, as well as reconciliation strategies for particular catchments and water supply systems; The Strategic Plan for South African Agriculture; The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, as well as provincial biodiversity sector plans and local bioregional plans; The Department of Health Strategic Plan; The Comprehensive Plan for the Development of Sustainable Human Settlements; and the National Framework for Disaster Risk Management.<br />
<br />
In order to monitor success of measures, South Africa will, within two years of the publication of the policy, design and publish a draft Climate Change Response Measurement and Evaluation System."

The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme.

The main driver for the law was to reduce the unsustainable tariff deficit of the electricity sector.

A new support scheme for renewable energy sources is planned, based on the direct participation of renewable energy sources in the market, forcing them to compete with traditional sources, although the scheme will allow renewable energies to recover costs that could not be recovered by selling energy on the market. The evaluation of such costs will be based on a theoretical renewable plant and on the average costs incurred by a well-managed company running said installation. Only administrative costs that are uniform at national level will be considered, so administrative costs at regional level are not considered in the framework of the law. The law allows for additional support schemes, but only if they are necessary to achieve European goals. With respect to grid access and grid use, renewables are granted priority connection and priority dispatch - provided that these do not constitute a danger to the grid itself.

Law 24/2013 regulates the economic framework for self-production-and consumption of electricity, a topic that had been in debate for months between different stakeholders. It states that entities that consume the energy they produce will have to make the same contribution to the financing of costs and services of the grid as consumers that take the electricity directly from the grid. This point had been at the centre of the debate and was strongly opposed by renewable energy associations, who thought it would create strong barriers to consumers installing their own renewable generating system. The fine for producers who access the self-consumption scheme incorrectly is set between EUR6m and EUR60m (USD7.53m-USD75.3m).

All self-consumers connected to the grid (see below) have to be registered with the Registry for Electrical Energy Self-Consumption, even if they do not ever intend on selling any surplus energy that they generate to the grid (isolated facilities exempt).<br />
There are two self-consumption modalities:<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li>'supply with self-consumption' - consumer with a contracted power of maximum 100 kW, owning at least one generation facility within its internal network, not registered as production facility</li><br />
<li>'production with self-consumption' - consumer associated to at least one generation facility connected within its network; the total power of the production facilities must be lower or equal to the consumer contracted power</li><br />
</ul><br />
The Decree allows for electricity storage devices installed within the self-consumption facilities, but makes them financially unattractive.<br />
All self-consumers have to pay 'access tolls' to the grid to contribute to its maintenance and operations. Tolls depend on the real use of the grid (contracted power and energy introduced in the border point). Under the second modality, 'access tolls' for feeding energy to the network are to be paid. In addition, all self-consumers have to pay the ""charges associated to the electricity system cost"", as well as the 'charge for other services of the system' (i.e. back-up of the self-consumer's facilities provided by the electrical system; can vary or be exempt for non-mainland territories and low voltage consumers - under 10 kW). Some existing facilities (e.g. cogeneration, small generation of <50 MW) are temporarily exempt from the charges until 31 December 2019.<br />
Both types of self-consumers can purchase additional electricity. However, only facilities registered under the second modality are entitled to receive a financial compensation for providing electricity to the grid. This prohibits individual small self-consumers from receiving compensation for any self-generated and unused electricity, unless they register as electricity production businesses."

The purpose of the law is to allow old nuclear reactors to be replaced with newer, safer models. It also reflects the recent shift towards new carbon technologies as opposed to a stronger expansion of renewable energies classified as counting towards climate mitigation. The Swedish parliament approved the act under the condition that no direct or indirect public funding may be available for the new nuclear power reactors.

<br />
The Integrated Climate and Energy Policy specifies targets for reducing GHG emissions and provides a joint action plan to achieve emission reductions. The climate tax package changes to different taxes and subsidies (2MtCO2e by 2020) to balance future increases in energy and environmental taxes for enterprises and households against equivalent tax concessions, allows for a tax exemption for green cars (emissions of less than 120g of CO2/km) from vehicle tax. Furthermore the bill contains a carbon tax, which increases for heating in industry outside the scope of EU ETS such as agriculture, forestry and aquaculture (30% in 2011, 60% in 2015) and reduces the carbon tax rebate for diesel. It also facilitates green investments in developing countries, climate policy and development co-operation and an increased focus on climate change adaptation (responsibility to co-ordinate climate adaptation is given to country administrative boards; adapt spatial planning to increased risks of landslides; research on how climate change affects the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services and how negative effects can be limited).<br />
<br />
The Integrated Climate and Energy Policy also contains action plans to promote renewable energy, improve energy efficiency and implement measures leading to a fossil-independent transportation sector.<br />
<br />
Targets outlined in this legislation include:<br />
- 40% GHGs from non-ETS sectors by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels)<br />
- 50% of energy consumption from renewable energy by 2020<br />
- 20% more efficient energy use (compared to 2008)<br />
- 10% renewable energy in the transportation sector<br />
- by 2020: a phase out of fossil fuels in heating<br />
- by 2030: a vehicle fleet that is independent of fossil fuels<br />
- by 2050: zero net emissions of GHGs in Sweden."

Given that one third of emissions occur in the road-based transportation sector, the fossil fuel independent vehicle fleet is a key contribution to Sweden's GHG emission reduction target.<br />
<br />
The key principle is to put a price on the GHG emissions emitted by the transportation sector and thus encouraging a move towards fossil fuel independent fuels as non-fossil fuel based vehicles are becoming cheaper than fossil fuel based vehicles. This is to be achieved through various policy instruments, measures, initiatives and incentives.<br />
<br />
These include carbon pricing (emission trading, energy and especially carbon taxes) in the transportation sector, increasing the dialogue between the government and the automotive cluster to strengthen its long-term competitiveness and promote greener fuel development and vehicle technology, extension of subsidies to establish filling stations for renewable fuels, increasing the share of biofuels in road transportation fuels via implementing the EU fuel quality directive (up to 10% share of biodiesel in the mixture), the requirement that thesustainability criteria must be fulfilled if the biofuels are to count towards the 10% target of fuels from renewable energy sources by 2020; mandating of binding emission standards for automotive manufacturers at 120gCO2/km for new passenger cars, which will be gradually reduced to 95gCO2/km in 2020; exploring the potential for the use of biogas (e.g. from waste) as transportation fuel, i.e. the development of 2nd generation biofuel via financial support (SEK875m USD118.4m) for biofuel demo-plants and the commercialisation of new energy technology; research and development initiatives to assess the incentives for the emerging electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids market, including appropriate stimulus and raising public awareness via consumer information on vehicle fuel consumption."

The revision consists in particular of extending the key climate protection instruments until the end of 2021. It helps prevent a regulatory vacuum until the complete revision of the CO2 law comes into force. The amendment to the ordinance also aims to implement a requirement of Parliament, namely a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 1.5% in 2021 compared to 1990. The Swiss people refused the law's full revision in June 2021.<br><br>The CO2 Act is at the core of Swiss climate legislation and has been updated several times, including for meeting Swiss commitments under the UNFCCC. The document has been fully revised several times since the 2000 CO2 Act. The <a href=""https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/20091310/index.html"">version in force</a> and the 2020 <a href=""https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/20120090/202001010000/641.711.pdf"">Ordinance 641.711</a> have been amended to cover the period post 1.1.2020.&nbsp;<br><br>The revision of 1 January 2013 sets out a number of targets, measures and strategies to address climate change via emission reductions in Switzerland, including market-based carbon trading mechanisms. Key aspects are:&nbsp;<br>- Emission reductions by 20% by 2020 below 1990 with domestic measures (possibly 30% depending on other nation's commitments); any increase beyond the -20% reduction can be met up to 75% with measures carried out abroad&nbsp;<br>- CO2 levy on thermal fuels 3 ct/l (CHF12 (USD12.5)/ t CO2) since 2008 and 9 ct/l (CHF36/t CO2 USD39.7/t CO2) since 2010 and CHF60 (USD62.7) since 2014 with further increases up to 30ct./l (CHF120(USD125.4)/tCO2) if predefined intermediate objectives for the emission reduction pathway until 2020 are not met&nbsp;<br>- The annual revenue of approximately CHF800m (USD835.8m) is to be redistributed to taxpayers and companies, with one third and not more than CHF300m (USD313.4m) to be channelled to the buildings programme and not more than CHF25m (USD26.1m) to the technology fund.&nbsp;<br>- CO2 emission limits for new cars (compatible with EU regulations).&nbsp;<br>- If companies join a binding agreement to reduce their energy-related CO2 emissions, there is the possibility to exempt companies from the CO2-levy&nbsp;<br>- Compensation of emissions from transportation sector via domestic projects&nbsp;<br>- National emission trading scheme, which can be linked with the European Emission Trading Scheme&nbsp;<br>- Co-ordination of domestic adaptation measures on the Federal level Reform of the Swiss ETS post-2012 to allow comparable situations for Swiss and EU companies and improve cost efficiency of emission trading&nbsp;<br>- Prepare linking with EU ETS&nbsp;<br>- Determine total cap and trade emission allowances for 2013-2020 with an annual reduction of allowances by 1.74%&nbsp;<br>- Sanctioning of each ton CO2 not covered by credit with CHF125(USD130.6) and obligation to surrender missing emission credits for the following year&nbsp;<br>- Carbon leakage sectors enjoy free allocation of emission allowances (up to benchmark), the free allocation for non-carbon leakage sectors is decreased and allowances are auctioned&nbsp;<br>- The Swiss ETS covers among others energy supply, processing of mineral oil, production and processing of metals, glass, ceramic, cement, production of paper, production of chemical products&nbsp;<br>- Expected coverage is 30-40 companies emitting 4-5 MtCO2, compulsory for large emitters with over &gt; 25'000 tCO2/year and a voluntary opt-in for medium size emitters (above 10 MW); companies participating in the emissions trading scheme are automatically exempted from the CO2 levy Measures in the transportation sector include the obligation for motor fuel importers to domestically offset CO2 emitted by the transportation sector (5-40%) and emission limits for new passenger cars.&nbsp;<br><br>Emissions in the buildings sector are to be reduced by technical prescriptions for buildings, a CO2 levy on fossil fuels and earmarking of the CO2 levy for the national buildings programme (financing the renovation of buildings). The Buildings programme aims to reduce CO2 emissions via lower energy use in buildings and support for renewable energy sources. One third of the revenues (and no more than CHF300m USD313.4m) from the CO2 tax and cantonal funds are channelled into the Building programme.&nbsp;<br><br>Two updates of the programme were necessary as a result of its popularity. These aim at accommodating the 48,000 applications that were received since 2010.&nbsp;<br><br>The 2000 CO2 Act focused on meeting the Kyoto Protocol commitment of overall GHG emission reductions of 8% in the 2008 - 2012 period compared to the 1990 base line. The CO2 Act set an emission reduction objective of 10% for CO2 emissions for the period 2008-12 compared to 1990 levels (CO2 emissions represent around 80% of Switzerland's GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol). It contained a number of policy measures, which were further specified in action plans, programmes and policies and have been amended based on the changes to the CO2 Act since 2000. Those include:&nbsp;<br>- CO2 levy for thermal fuels&nbsp;<br>- Climate cent on transportation fuels&nbsp;<br>- Voluntary commitments&nbsp;<br>- Cross-cutting measures in areas suitable to climate policy integration&nbsp;<br>- Use of cap and trade market mechanisms and flexible mechanisms - Requires the Federal Council to propose further GHG emission reduction targets for period after 2012 leading up to 2020.</div>"

The main aim of the Act is to contribute to an adequate energy supply - i.e. diversified, safe, economical and compatible with the requirements of environmental protection. Its principal goals include:<br>&nbsp;- ensure production and distribution of economic power, compatible with the requirements of environmental protection<br>&nbsp;- promote the efficient and rational use of energy<br>&nbsp;- encourage the use of indigenous and renewable energy.<br>&nbsp;The Act provides three main targets, to be reached in co-operation with the Cantons, the energy sector and other stakeholders:<br>&nbsp;- The average annual electricity production from renewable sources is to be increased by at least 5,400 GWh by 2030 compared to 2000. Up to 10% of the required target can be met by renewable electricity generation abroad (e.g.CDM).<br>&nbsp;- The average annual hydro-power production is to increase by at least 2,000 GWh by 2030 compared to 2000<br>&nbsp;- Households' final energy consumption must be stabilised by 2030 at the level it would have had at the entry into force of this provision (2009).<br>&nbsp;Among the measures put forward by the Act to meet the above targets are certification of electricity origin (renewable electricity certificates), preferential installation of new renewable electricity or CHP compared to fossil fuel plants, mandatory offtake for renewable electricity for utilities (conditions apply) with financial support for solar PV plants (30kW max), and energy labelling for buildings, vehicles and appliances.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Energy Ordinance specifies the provisions of the Energy Act:<br>&nbsp;It includes provisions for a feed-in tariff for electricity from solar PV, wind, hydro (up to 10MW), geothermal and biomass. The payments are made for 10, 20 or 25 years and are differentiated according to application, technology and size of the installation. They only apply to installations built, renovated or expanded after 1 January 2006. The overall funding for available feed-in tariffs is capped in 2015 at approximately CHF580m (USD605.9m), with funds to be distributed among the different types of technologies so as to ensure their parallel development (the entire fund cannot assigned to one single technology).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The making of the New Energy Act started on September 30, 2016, to enhance its previously stated goals over the period until 2035 of a sustainable security of supply, efficiency, reduced overall energy consumption and increase of domestic renewable energy use. The referendum of May 21st, 2017, decided for a ""complete revision"" of the Act that will enter into force on January 1, 2018. Revisions under the new Act include an increased promotion of renewables, which will benefit of a grid fee raised to 2,3 ct./kWh. However, the new system of subsidies is limited to the end of 2022 and plants under 1 MW of capacity won't be accepted anymore. Smart metering systems also get enhanced legal rights. Energy efficiency targets for private motorised vehicles (cars) are indexed to the European Union limits, and subsidies will be included for vehicles emitting less than 50g of CO2 per km will be applied from 2020 to 2022.

The Action Plan identifies the major policy directions and priorities to reduce GHG emission and adapt to climate change under national policy. This policy functions as the basis for implementation by all levels of governments and sectors.<br />
<br />
The Action Plan starts with an analysis of trends and scenarios of climate change and anthropogenic GHG emissions. The gases subject to analysis are: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and perfluorocarbons. Impacts on water resources are regarded as the key concern in the face of climate change, due to glacier retreat, increase in evaporation and decrease in river flow due to temperature rise. Change in regional hydrological cycles is expected to have destructive impact on the scale and impact of natural disasters. Change in water quality is considered a significant threat to ecosystems, biodiversity and economy (e.g. irrigation). Vector-born and other dangerous diseases (including malaria), agricultural pests and diseases strong winds and sandstorms, heavy rainfalls, floods and mudflows, high temperature, extreme temperature variation and hot winds derived from climate change are expected to damage agriculture and public health.<br />
<br />
To mitigate such climate change impacts, the proposed approaches are to reduce GHG emissions and to adapt to climate change. The measures to reduce GHGs (as a fulfilment of UNFCCC obligations) include: enhancement of energy efficiency in relevant sectors of the national economy; application of effective technologies and use of energy sources in the national economy (that promotes high economy growth rate and reduce or limit GHG emissions); protection and enhancement of natural sinks and reservoirs of GHGs; promotion of sustainable forest management practices, afforestation and reforestation; promotion of sustainable agriculture; development and research on renewable (and new) energies and environmentally sounds technologies for use; and encouragement of appropriate reforms in relevant sectors aimed at promoting policies and measures that reduce GHG emissions.<br />
<br />
Principles and direction of adaptation include: research on climate change and its impact on national resources, economy public health and development of additional adaptation measures; improvement of the systematic observation network and environmental monitoring to renew adaptation measures; improvement of systems to collect, analyze, interpret and disseminate data among end users; enhancement of weather forecasting, climate modelling and early warning systems to minimize the risk of natural disasters; capacity building to strengthen institutional, technical and human resources to promote adaptation in the fields of climate change and hydrological research, geographical information systems, environmental impact assessment, protection and re-cultivation of lands rational use of water resources, conservation of ecosystems, sustainable agriculture, infrastructure development and health protection; and implementation of actual projects on adaptation on priority areas related to rational use of natural resources, economy and health protection."

This plan aims to provide the crop-agriculture sub-sector of Tanzania with a risk-based analysis and, subsequently, a plan for meeting the most urgent challenges posed by climate change.<br />
<br />
Following from a risk assessment detailed in the Plan, three priority risks are identified: (i) amplified water stress; (ii) decreased crop yield, and (iii) increased vulnerability of smallholder farmers. Following from the risk analysis, the plan outlines four 'priority resilience actions:' (i) improving agricultural land and water management, (ii) accelerating uptake of climate smart agriculture (CSA), (iii) improving risk management to reduce climate-related shocks, (iv) strengthening knowledge and systems to target climate action. Specific policy highlights aimed at addressing the former include: the establishment of pest, disease, and early warning systems; the development of policy briefs and financial incentives to assist with mainstreaming CSA into agricultural programmes; the updating of irrigation master plans to consider availability and climate; incentivising the development of water management technologies.<br />

The policy notes that the level of knowledge on climate change and its impacts remains low in Uganda. Therefore, it seeks to raise awareness of climate change, targeting sectorial weaknesses (to be determined by different governmental agencies and ministries) in the short term but providing information for a wide variety of stakeholders in the long term.<br />
To this end, the Policy adopts a comprehensive approach to address climate change, identifying as priority concerns: adaptation, mitigation, monitoring, and research. To address these concerns, the Policy promotes the implementation of activities relating to: education and increased awareness; gender issues; promoting and diffusing research; monitoring and transferring knowledge; and institutional capacity building.<br />
The policy calls for the adoption and implementation of a Transport Policy with emphasis on reducing GHG emissions from this sector, especially through the promotion of the use of less carbon intensive fuels. It also stresses the importance of the implementation of the 2007 Renewable Energy Policy and other measures that promote the use and the production of renewables.<br />
The adoption of climate change strategies that address the impact of climate change and promote sustainable activities in the sectors of agriculture and livestock, fishery production, water management, forestry, wetland, biodiversity and ecosystem services and tourism are identified are important needs to develop Uganda's approach to adaption to climate change.<br />
Moreover, the Policy also seeks to implement the basic institutional structure required to finance this awareness raising campaign and to develop a performance measurement framework for each ministry and agency involved. The policy also strengthens the Climate Change Unit, upgrading it to a National Climate Change Commission with a more advanced legal and institutional framework that can co-ordinate climate change policy across sectors and regions. The Policy Committee on Environment is also strengthened to help guide climate change policy implementation.<br />
As annex to the Climate Change Policy, the Cost Implementation Strategy provides a more detailed account on the implementation of the Policy, including an indicative costing for the programmes and activities to be developed. Thus, according to the document, the total cost for the implementation of the Climate Change Policy is estimated in approximately 3.9 billion dollars over a 15-year period."

The Government's overarching policy vision for renewable energy is to make modern renewable energy a substantial part of national energy consumption, where modern renewable energy is understood to mean renewable energy resources that are transformed into modern energy services like electricity.<br />
To achieve its goal, a number of supporting objectives are identified. These include: maintaining and improving the responsiveness of the legal and institutional framework to promote renewable energy investments; establishing an financing and fiscal policy framework for investments in renewable energy; increasing public awareness in renewable energy and promoting investment in this area; promoting research and development as well as international co-operation in renewable energy technologies (RETs); utilizing biomass energy efficiently and sustainably; and promoting the conversion of municipal and industrial waste to energy.<br />
Various strategies and policy actions are elaborated in order to achieve these objectives. A power generation programme will support public and private sector investments in renewable energy, focussing on large hydropower schemes (hydropower being the most well developed RET) as well as small and more diverse schemes. A rural and urban-poor electricity access programme will support the development of RETs in dispersed and remote settlements. A modern energy services programme will support RETs such as solar PV and solar water heaters, a biofuels programme will support improvements in biofuel technology, and a waste for energy programmes will support the conversion of waste to energy. An energy efficiency programmes will implement the Uganda Energy Efficiency Strategy.<br />
<br />
The responsibility for the policy lies with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development and a Renewable Energy Department is to be developed within the Ministry. Moreover, a special financial mechanism, a credit support facility known as the Uganda Energy Capitalisation Trust, is instituted to help realise the policy. The ultimate goal of the Renewable Energy Policy is to increase the use of modern renewable energy, from the current 4% to 61% of the total energy consumption by the year 2017."

The NEMP aims to address these issues by establishing a more comprehensive and integrated approach to environmental issues.<br />
The NEMP, therefore, creates a National Environment Management Authority, a legal framework for climate issues, an effective monitoring and evaluation system to track the effects of different policies on the environment, population and economy, attempts to promote a new sustainable conservation culture and, finally, to harmonise local and national policy efforts on environmental issues.<br />
Specifically, the NEMP recognizes climate as a 'vital natural resource' that needs to be monitored in order to better direct land use, encourage sustainable economic development, and manage air pollution, and GHG emissions."

<br />
The Plan sets out how the UK will achieve decarbonisation within the framework of energy policy - making a transition to a low carbon economy while maintaining energy security and minimising costs to consumers (particularly those in poorer households).<br />
<br />
The Plan sets out proposals and policies to meet the UK's first four carbon budgets, each lasting five years with increasing emissions reductions targets. The fourth budget, for the period 2023-2027, requires emissions to be reduced by 50% compared to 1990 levels.<br />
<br />
The plan includes 5 sectoral plans, covering measures to be taken during this decade and in the 2020s:<br />
- Low carbon buildings, including energy efficiency and low carbon heating<br />
- Low carbon transport<br />
- Low carbon industry<br />
- Low carbon electricity<br />
- Agriculture, land use, forestry and waste<br />
<br />
The government will support up to 1.5 million solid wall insulations and other energy efficiency measures, introduce zero-carbon home standards to support energy efficiency improvements. It will also support over 130,000 low carbon heat installations by 2020 and work with local authorities to support district heating networks. The Plan sets out that emissions from buildings should be 24%-39% lower than 2009 levels by 2027.<br />
<br />
The government will support the market roll-out of ultra-low emission vehicles and the take-up of other lower carbon travel methods (walking, cycling, public transport), with the aim that transport emissions should be 17%-28% lower than 2009 levels by 2027.<br />
Emissions from industry will be reduced by 20%-24% compared to 2009 levels by 2027, through a mix of energy efficiency measures, low carbon fuel use, EU ETS membership, and CCS development.<br />
<br />
By 2027, emissions from electricity should be 75%-84% lower than 2009 levels. These reductions will come from increasing use of gas and renewables instead of coal, the introduction of Contacts for Difference in feed-in tariffs, and support for renewables development, CCS development, and reductions in the cost of offshore wind. The Plan does not set any specific technology or decarbonisation targets, and supports the lowest cost mix of nuclear, renewables and CCS use by 2027.<br />
<br />
The Plan envisages significant reductions in methane emissions from landfill by 2050, as part of the move towards a zero waste economy."

The Act establishes a legally binding target for the UK to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. It also creates 5-yearly 'carbon budgets' as a pathway to meet the long-term target. The Act has now established a legally binding target of at least an 100% cut in GHG emissions by 2050, to be achieved through action in the UK and abroad. Ministers must report on the policies implemented to meet carbon budgets and produce an annual report to Parliament on the status of UK emissions. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) - an independent, expert body to advise the government on the level of carbon budgets and on progress in meeting these budgets - submits annual reports to Parliament on progress towards targets and budgets. The government must respond to the reports, ensuring transparency and accountability.&nbsp;<br><br>The Act sets up a carbon budgeting system that caps emissions over 5-year periods, with three budgets set at a time, to help the UK stay on track for its 2050 target. The first three carbon budgets run from 2008-2012, 2013-2017 and 2018-2022, and were set in law in May 2009. The fourth carbon budget, for 2023-2027 approved by parliament in 2011 and reviewed in 2014, puts into law a target to reduce emissions by 50% from 1990 levels by 2025 (the midpoint of the budget period). The government must report to Parliament its policies and proposals to meet the budgets and set a limit on the purchase of carbon credits for each budgetary period - for the first budgetary period, a zero limit was set in May 2009, excluding units bought by UK participants in the EU Emissions Trading System. For the second budget period, a limit of 55MtCO2e was set.&nbsp;<br><br>The Act also gives powers to introduce domestic emissions trading schemes more quickly and easily through secondary legislation - the first use has been to introduce the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme. The Act introduced measures on biofuels and powers to introduce pilot financial incentive schemes in England for household waste. The Act requires, by the end of 2012, the inclusion of international aviation and shipping emissions in the net carbon account, or an explanation to Parliament why not. The government announced in December 2012 that this decision would be deferred, recognising uncertainty over the international framework for reducing aviation emissions and particularly the treatment of aviation within the EU ETS. The new net zero target still excludes aviation and shipping.&nbsp;<br><br>The government must report at least every 5 years on the risks to the UK of climate change, and publish a programme setting out how these will be addressed. The first such climate change risk assessment was published in 2012. The Act also introduces powers for government to require public bodies and statutory undertakers to carry out their own risk assessment and make plans to address those risks. The Act introduces an Adaptation Sub-Committee of the Committee on Climate Change, providing advice to, and scrutiny of, the Government's adaptation work. ****** The fifth carbon budget (adopted in June 2016) has set emission reduction levels to 57% compared with 1990 levels. It covers the period between 2028-2032 and is in line with the UK's global commitments. The recommended budget and its latest progress report, the CCC (Committee on Climate Change) listed some recommendations in the form of priorities for policy development, including:&nbsp;<br><br></div><ul><li>Enabling mature low carbon energy sources (e.g. onshore wind) to come to market</li><li>Defining how energy efficiency improvements shall be financed and delivered</li><li>Increasing adoption of low carbon heat, which includes policies to overcoming behavioural barriers</li><li>Extending vehicle efficiency targets through the 2020s, coupled with policies to increase use of electric vehicles</li><li>In order to decarbonise effectively by 2050, the CCC has called for all new investment from 2020 onwards in power to be low carbon, excluding back-up and balancing plant. From 2035 onwards, the same will apply to all investments in transport and head.</li></ul><div><br>The sixth carbon budget was adopted by Parliament on June 22th, 2021.&nbsp;</div>"

The Code provides a single national standard to guide industry in the design and construction of sustainable homes, considering energy among other aspects.<br />
<br />
Since 2007 the developer of any new home in England can choose to be assessed against the Code. From 2008 it was mandatory for all new homes to be rated against the Code and to include a Code or nil-rated certificate within the Home Information Pack. Even though the requirement for the Home Information Pack for property sales was suspended in 2010, an Energy Performance Certificate is still required.<br />
<br />
There are six levels of the Code, with mandatory minimum standards for energy efficiency at each level. Level 1 represents a 10% improvement in energy efficiency over the 2006 Building Regulations. Level 6 would be a completely zero-carbon home (heating, lighting, hot water and all appliances).<br />
<br />
Improvements in the energy efficiency of new homes of more than 25% compared to 2006 regulations (Level 3 of the code) would probably require some form of low- or zero-carbon energy generation, either by individual buildings (eg dedicated solar water heating) or by whole developments sharing a source of low carbon generation (eg wind turbines)."

The Strategy comes in line with the commitment made under the 2008 Climate Change Act that requires the country to reduce its emissions ""by at least 80% by 2050"". The Strategy acknowledges that efforts to reduce emissions will have to significantly ramp up in order to meet the fourth and fifth carbon budgets (covering the periods 2023-2027 and 2028-2032). Beyond setting up the strategy to 2032, the document explores electrification, hydrogen and emissions removal as three pathways to 2050.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Strategy firstly highlights the image of leadership and situation of progress that the country has made in the last two decades. It details the economic opportunities brought by the Paris Agreement for its low-carbon industries, notably thanks to its academic strength, expertise in high-value service and financial industries and stable regulatory framework. According to the document, the low carbon sector could grow by around 11% a year on the period 2015-2030, or four times faster than the overall economy, and ""could deliver between £60 billion and £170 billion of export sales of goods and services by 2030"". The document also mentions the co-benefits of actions to reduce greenhouse gases emissions on local air quality, public health, the economy and the environment. The Strategy also recalls the objective of energy affordability and the fact that leaving the EU represents an opportunity as ""domestic binding emissions targets are more ambitious than those set by EU legislation"".<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;A number of more precise objectives are detailed as following: 1) develop green finance capabilities, including by setting up a green finance taskforce and providing up to £20 million to support a new clean technology early stage investment fund,- 2) develop a package of measures to support businesses to improve their energy productivity, by at least 20% by 2030,- 3) improving energy efficiency and aiming at reducing emissions from homes by 19% and energy use by 9%,- 4) rolling out low carbon heating,- 5) accelerate the shift to low carbon transport and reduce emissions by 29% by relying mostly on electric vehicles,- 6) deliver clean, smart, flexible power,- 7)enhance the benefits and value of domestic natural resources,- 8) and lead in the public sector. The government also commits £2.5 billion of investment in transport (33% of the total), power, cross-sector, smart systems, homes, business and industry, land use and waste.</div>"

It requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop and enforce regulations to protect the general public from exposure to airborne contaminants that are known to be hazardous to human health and/or welfare.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Congress passed the first Clean Air Act in 1963, creating a research and regulatory programme in the US Public Health Service. The Act authorised development of emission standards for stationary sources. In the Clean Air Act Extension of 1970, Congress greatly expanded the federal mandate by requiring comprehensive federal and state regulations for both industrial and mobile sources. The law established four new regulatory programmes:<br>&nbsp;- National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) - EPA was required to promulgate national standards for six criteria pollutants: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, particulate matter, hydrocarbons and photochemical oxidants (some of the criteria pollutants were revised in subsequent legislation)<br>&nbsp;- State Implementation Plans (SIPs)<br>&nbsp;- New Source Performance Standards (NSPS)<br>&nbsp;- National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The EPA was also created under the National Environmental Policy Act about the same time as these additions were passed, which was important to help implement the programmes listed above.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Since then, the Clean Air Act has been amended (in 1977 and 1990) to strengthen its effect, including adding regulations relating to acid deposition (to tackle acid rain) and stratospheric ozone protection. The EPA's 2009 finding that GHG emissions endanger health and welfare opened the door to EPA regulation of substances for their GHG effect. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The EPA began regulating GHGs from mobile and stationary sources of air pollution under the Clean Air Act for the first time in 2011. Standards for mobile sources have been established. The EPA also promulgated <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-air-pollution/clean-air-act-standards-and-guidelines-electric-utilities"">standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants</a> and from other stationary sources. <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-air-pollution/nsps-ghg-emissions-new-modified-and-reconstructed-electric-utility"">New Source Performance Standards</a> from new, modified and reconstructed power plants were reinstated by the Biden administration in March 2021. Public Law no 117-23 was signed by President Biden on June 30th, 2021, to cancel the rule submitted by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency by the Trump administration on September 14th, 2020 to roll back restrictions on methane emissions in the oil and gas sector (85 Fed.

The Act extends the 'production tax credit' (PTC) for wind facilities provided by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code per kilowatt-hour of renewable electricity production for facilities beginning construction before 1 January 2020. This change applies retroactively from 1 January 2015 (when the previous guarantee for PTC originally expired). The Act also includes a phase-out provision, under which the volume of PTC depends on beginning of the construction of the wind facilities: 20% reduction of PTC if construction begins in 2017, 40% reduction of PTC if construction begins in 2018, and 60% reduction of PTC if construction begins in 2019.<br />
The Act allows wind facilities brought into service before 1 January 2020 to choose the 'investment tax credit' (ITC) program, based upon a percentage of each energy property brought into service during any taxable year, instead of the PTC program. The ITC program applies similar percentage-based phase-out support as the PTC program.<br />
The Act extends the ITC program for solar energy until 2021, with a percentage-based phase-out provision. The energy credit reduces from 30% to 26% percent for facilities upon which construction begins after 31 December 2019 and further to 22% percent for facilities upon which construction begins after 31 December 2020. It is estimated that the solar ITC provision of the Act will add '220,000 new jobs by 2020, cut 100 million tons of emissions, and lead to $133 billion invested in the U.S. economy' (http://www.seia.org/news/seia-celebrates-extension-itc)."

The law supports a broad variety of power generation options, including oil, coal and natural gas, hydroelectric power, wind, solar, geothermal and other renewable sources of power, as well as energy efficiency and distribution and transmission systems upgrades. The Electricity Africa Act however particularly promotes renewable energy projects, as the law requires the U.S. government to promote the spread of distributed renewable energy in sub-Saharan Africa, including off-grid lighting and power. The priority given to off-grid generation is an endorsement of existing efforts, already carried out by a sub-initiative of Power Africa Initiative (see below).<br />
To create lasting infrastructures, the law seeks to promote policies to facilitate private financing and public-private partnerships, allow independent producers' participation in electricity markets, and encourage other regulatory reforms in the power sector. The law calls on the US to partner with sub-Saharan African countries, international and regional financial institutions and the private sector to meet the above goals and implement a strong monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.<br />
The Electricity Africa Act does not allocate new funds to the US agencies, but builds on and backs the <a href=""https://www.dlapiper.com/en/china/insights/publications/2013/07/us-commits-$7b-to-ambitious-power-africa-initiat__/"">Power Africa Initiative</a>, launched in 2013 with a goal of doubling access to electricity across sub-Saharan Africa. The Initiative commits the US to US$7 billion support to the energy sector in sub-Saharan Africa.<br />
The law requires the President of the U.S. to submit to the US Senate, within 6 months of the law's enactment, a report outlining a multiyear strategy for reaching the objectives of the law.<br />
The Electricity Africa Act also directs U.S. government agencies, such as US Agency for International Development (USAID), the US Trade and Development Agency, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), and the Millennium Challenge Corporation, to prioritize loans, grants and technical support for power generation and transmission projects in sub-Saharan Africa. The President of the U.S. is allowed by the law to establish an interagency working group to coordinate efforts among the agencies."

- Administration<br />
- Environmental impact assessments<br />
- Biodiversity<br />
- Bio-prospecting laws and community conservation areas (CCAs)<br />
<br />
The Amendment Act makes a number of important changes directly relevant to climate change.It includes a definition of climate change ('a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods', page 3), adds the concept of ecosystem services and processes to the Act, and applies the precautionary principle to any decision made regarding the environment that may risk human health or threaten damage to the environment. It also specifies that any decision made under the terms of the Act must be guided by consideration of climate change adaptation and mitigation issues.<br />
<br />
The Act requires that the director of the department responsible for the environment must include in their Environmental Registry a climate change database in joint co-ordination with the National Advisory Committee on Climate Change. It also requires that the National State of the Environment Report, published at least once every 10 years, must include a description of national climate change activities, impacts and issues. It requires that climatic considerations and issues be incorporated into any National Policy for the conservation, sustainable development and management of the environment. Further, it specifically identifies climate mitigation as a critical ecosystem service that may be provided by sites of national biodiversity significance and enables the Minister to make any regulations necessary to uphold Vanuatu's obligations under the UNFCCC for climate change adaptation and mitigation.<br />
<br />
It establishes an Environmental Trust Fund, funded by penalties and bonds, which is to fund research, environmental rehabilitation, monitoring and analysis, management of community conservation areas, and as required for the protection and conservation of the environment.It also makes several amendments to enforcement provisions, environmental impact assessment procedures, bio-prospecting processes, and details of what constitutes an offence (and the associated punishments) under the 2002 Act."

It enables a proprietor of a lease (as registered under the Land Leases Act) to grant a forestry right over the land covered by the lease.<br />
<br />
The definition of forestry right includes a carbon sequestration right which is defined as ‘a right conferred by agreement or otherwise to the legal, commercial or other benefit (whether present or future) of carbon sequestration by any existing or future tree or forest on the land'. The Act therefore establishes a separate property right that enables carbon rights to be decoupled from land rights (and thus provides for the allocation of carbon rights). However, while almost all land in Vanuatu is held under customary tenure, only approximately 9% is leased, with a further 90% unleased. Therefore the majority of landholders will not be able to exercise similar rights to forest carbon.<br />

The National Electoral Council reported tonight that 71% of votes were in favor of the new charter while 28.79 percent were against it. The turnout was 44.4% of Venezuela's 11 million registered voters; this low turnout was attributed to a certain extent to torrential rains around the period that the referendum took place. This Constitution has since been amended once, in 2009. In 2017, Maduro’s government started moving towards creating a new Constitution, although this caused widespread objection objections and it still has not led to a new charter to replace the 1999 Constitution. Within the current Constitution’s environmental rights chapter, Chapter IX, develops a right to sustainable development and establishes that the State shall protect a series of environmental areas. Moreover, article 127 establishes a fundamental duty of the State to ensure a pollution-free environment where climate, among other environmental topics, receives special protection. This provision states the following: “It is the right and duty of each generation to protect and maintain the environment for its own benefit and that of the world of the future. Everyone has the right, individually and collectively, to enjoy a safe, healthful and ecologically balanced life and environment. The State shall protect the environment, biological and genetic diversity, ecological processes, national parks and natural monuments, and other areas of particular ecological importance. The genome of a living being shall not be patentable, and the field shall be regulated by the law relating to the principles of bioethics. It is a fundamental duty of the State, with the active participation of society, to ensure that the populace develops in a pollution-free environment in which air, water, soil, coasts, climate, the ozone layer and living species receive special protection, in accordance with law.”</div>"

<br />
The document provides that tackling climate change is one of the policy priorities for the country's development. It recognises climate change challenges to social and economic development and states that 'the Medium Term Plan places climate change concerns at the centre of development strategies, plans and programmes in all sectors of the economy, particularly agriculture, energy, water, forestry, mining and tourism.' The main policy objective is to promote climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies in social and economic development at national and sectoral level. To achieve this, the MTP promises the development of a national climate change strategy and a national climate change policy by the end of 2013; development of a national action plan for adaptation and mitigation by the end of 2012; and to increase the integration of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in economic and development activities and policies at national and sectoral level by the end of 2012. Additional policy measures include the promotion of the use of evidence-based approaches to policy planning and programming related to climate change and development; the promotion of broad-based participation in the formulation and implementation of a national climate change strategy and policy; and raising awareness of national climate change strategy and policy.<br />
<br />
The document identifies following challenges and constraints to achieve low carbon growth: existence of an uncoordinated policy and institutional framework governing climate change issues; existence of multiple and diverse organizations working on climate change; fragmented policy responses to the country's development challenges without much coordination between the Government and other stakeholders, and across sectors; and lack of sufficient funds and technical capacity to undertake policy relevant research and conduct any long term planning, undermine the development of a national climate change strategy and policy."
